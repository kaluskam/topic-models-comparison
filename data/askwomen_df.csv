But how to make a choice when both alternatives are about the same? For example, you want to be an artist or a lawyer. The profession of a lawyer guarantees you stability and a good salary. But on the other hand, deep down want to be an artist, although you risk living in poverty. You can't choose both. But it's really hard decision. 

Or another situation: you want to have kids, but don’t want them now. On the one hand, you love children. But on the other hand, you do not want to donate 18-20 years of your life for raising your children, you are used to living freely, you/re used to traveling and doing whatever you want.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Thersday Thursday Initial Announcement,52,1,"Announcing T***her***sday: A Day Dedicated to Questions About Women.

Thanks to the success and popularity of Mate-Free Monday and based on the feedback received about themed days on our 2019 Community Feedback survey, we are piloting a new themed day on Thursdays during the month of May. Our pilot of T***her***sday will begin on May 14 and run each Thursday from 12am ET and (-5 GMT) until 12am on Friday through the end of May.

T***her***sday is a day for questions focusing on women and women's experiences only.  No questions related specifically about men/male behaviors will be permitted on Thursdays. This includes questions about women's thoughts on men's words, appearances, actions, or anything else related to men. Everyone is welcome to participate in T***her***sday regardless of your own gender, but questions should remain focused on women and their experiences and opinions.

Examples of things we'll remove:

* What do you think of men who x?
* How does it make you feel when men x?
* What are your best/worst experiences with men?
* If a man does x, how would you react?

If you have any questions about these supplemental rules, please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskWomen&subject=Questions+about+mate+free+monday) and we will be happy to discuss it with you.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

"Where to actually find trendy ""good quality"" clothing?",371,184,"I'm constantly seeing people say to not shop fast fashion, and instead buy high quality, longer-lasting pieces. But where do you buy these clothes? I really like sites like Shein because the clothes are actually cute and stylish, but the quality is crap and I can only wear it two times. Yet when I shop stores that are supposedly not fast fashion, like everlane, the clothes are very basic. Plus, I feel like even stores that people associate with good quality, like Nordstrom, aren't THAT much better than shein when it comes to quality, there's just more of a price mark up. 

Thoughts? Recommendations? I'm constantly torn between shopping at shein/romwe for the cute clothes, or shopping at stores like everlane for better quality but boring style. Where do I find genuinely good quality, stylish clothes?

EDIT: thanks for all of the replies! I think I should clear up a few things. 

One: I think me mentioning fast fashion made it seem like I’m ONLY looking for ethical fashion. I am not (sorry to say). I just want to find high quality clothing. I’m also not really on a budget, I mention SHEIN because they genuinely have cute stuff, regardless of how cheap it is. If I could find their clothes, but that will last for years at $100, I’d buy in a heartbeat. 

Two: second hand doesn’t equal good quality in my mind. I’ve donated tons of target/forever 21/romwe clothes, and I think it’s the same for many others, so much so that now even thrift stores are full of mall shop clothing. 

I think maybe there is no answer to my question haha and maybe I’d be better off looking into how to tell if clothing is high quality, that way I can shop anywhere and just know what to look for!",2020-05-10

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Apologies if the title lack elaboration.

Edit 2: I didnt expect this much responses but thank you 😭😭

Edit 3: To the people who have been asking/wondering what a Manic Pixie Dream Girl is: basically just means a quirky, spontaneous, eccentric girl whose sole purpose is to bring the typically recluse, depressed or broken man out of their comfort zones and live life or whatever. In real life, the MPDG may manifest differently and those experiences are what I'm looking for.

Edit 4: Most probably not going to reply anymore, but I took so much from all of the responses. A lot of women accept the role (though I acknowledge some of the tropes aren't necessarily performative/fake) often as coping mechanisms on trauma agaisnt men and patriarchal femininity (a generalization of course). It's depressing because growing up under the male gaze as a young woman while coming in terms with ourselves is perpetually exhausting, feeding a need to constantly perform becomes a norm for us. I honestly just wanted to hear out on women's  stories in real life, and it truly never occurred to me just how many women could relate to this. Of course, I take into account that there are so many social/cultural factors that come in place which cannot be ignored and hard to undo. Ultimately, I only want to say we are all a working progress and to celebrate change and growth in all of us whenever necessary. Much love x

Happy Thersday,54,2,"
   Thanks to the success and popularity of Mate-Free Monday and based on the feedback received about themed days on our 2019 Community Feedback survey, we are piloting a new themed day on Thursdays during the month of May. Our pilot of Thersday will begin on May 14 and run each Thursday from 12am ET and (-5 GMT) until 12am on Friday through the end of May.

   Thersday is a day for questions focusing on women and women's experiences only. No questions related specifically about men/male behaviors will be permitted on Thursdays. This includes questions about women's thoughts on men's words, appearances, actions, or anything else related to men. Everyone is welcome to participate in Thersday regardless of your own gender, but questions should remain focused on women and their experiences and opinions.

  Examples of things we'll remove:

  * What do you think of men who x?
  * How does it make you feel when men x?
  * What are your best/worst experiences with men?
  * If a man does x, how would you react?

 
If you have any questions about these supplemental rules, please message the moderators and we will be happy to discuss it with you.

I would like to know if anyone has tangible and helpful experience or knowledge on how to treat situations like Title or family.

Edit & background - I appreciate the responses received for their thorough opinions, thought processes, and intentions. I would like to clarify that this question came to heart after venting to my father about two friends who were attacked by police over the weekend in Minneapolis. One who is black was yanked off her porch while peacefully protesting and was arrested; circulation was cut off in their wrists for a time with deep grooves created by the cuffs lasting overnight. The second was peacefully protesting with a crowd when shot in the head without warning or notice or request to leave, by a cop, with a rubber bullet, which fractured their skull; they are hospitalized. My father's response was to say they should have expected to be shot in the head. I have chosen not to escalate. I have been grouped into his rationalization of ""animal,"" I am bewildered because I grew up as a Christian with him so I believed he valued neighbors and life. I'm so sad. Everything happening to belittle the blm movement or George Floyd's death is incredibly disheartening.",2020-06-03

This is an open conversational topic about the issue.",4740,172,"This is an open conversational thread to discuss the recent police murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, and the many others who have been needlessly killed purposefully and negligently at the hands of the police. While some subreddits have gone dark for 24 hours, and some are going dark for 9 minutes, we wanted to find a line that allowed us to allow space for our community to discuss this matter, but also time to reflect on the loss of life and injustice. With that said, we recognize that we are a unique community on Reddit, and we want to give space for the women (and anyone else) of this community to discuss this topic which is why we opted out of a 24 out blackout. Specifically, the 9-minute number was significant to our moderator team in the relevance for how long George Floyd was crushed under that killer's leg. 

Please use this topic discuss Black Lives Matter, how you feel right now, what you are doing, or ways to offer support. Because of the open nature of this topic, we will be loosening restrictions on derailing to foster more conversation beyond Q&A format. **What we will not permit any sort of racism, invalidation, whataboutism, or attempts to rationalize these inexcusable murders. If you violate any of our rules on these matters, you risk a permanent ban.**  Below are some organizations you can donate to,  and if you are looking to further this conversation please check out /r/blacklivesmatter, or /r/blackladies- but DO NOT post in those communities without reviewing their rules and guidelines first.

EDIT: We are seeing multiple questions about how we came to this timing choice and why. I detailed the it in another post but to copy and paste

>George Floyd was killed at 8:08 CDT. A police officer pressed his knee into the back of his neck for 9 minutes, killing him. That is how we got the start time. 

>The 2-hour additional window was because some subreddits went black/private for 24 hours, and some did so for 9 minutes. After a prolonged conversation with the mod team (involving multiple moderators who are black) the choice came down to two hours because it was felt that 9 minutes would not impact/affect enough users to give proper pause to the loss of life and injustice, but at the same time it felt like a disservice to our community to shut down for such a prolonged period of time, given how hostile Reddit is to many members of our community, especially at moments like this.",2020-06-03

Edit 2: I have read through every reply and cried a bit because it’s heartbreaking to see so many individuals going through the same thing. I really appreciate the support and compassion. It’s therapeutic to know that I am not hysterical and my voice is valid. Here are my key take aways:

* Document everything and bring the information to each appointment 
* Be vocal and advocate for yourself. 
* Recognize that being a woman of color with Bi-polar disorder makes this more challenging 
* Research doctors and give feedback on negative experiences. 
* Trust your body and perceiver for a solution

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

"Do most women groom their eyebrows, and if so how?",12,44,"I know this sounds like a funny question, but growing up male, there's not much that I ever learned about beauty or cosmetic techniques of any sort. A lot of things that women have known since the age of 6, I've only discovered with thorough digging and research. It's kind of funny how that is, isn't it?

I've often noticed that women tend to have neater, sharper, more angular and colorful looking eyebrows, generally speaking. I can only assume this is cosmetically done. So I'm just kind of wondering - do most women do up their eyebrows in some way, in addition to or as part of their makeup routine? Also wondering if they actually shave or trim them? If so, how often is this ""eyebrow maintenance"" required?  What kinds of tools or routines do you use? Or, how many of you don't actually do anything to your eyebrows?

I have reason to believe there must be something to this, because there's actually a local shop near me that's just called ""eyebrows"". Apparently there's nothing money can't buy, even a nice pair of eyebrows.

"Does not reporting someone make you a bad feminist, knowing other women may potentially be victims? Share your thoughts",1,17,"TRIGGER WARNING: sexual assault 

If Einstein’s statement “if I were to remain silent, I would be guilty of complicity” is true - does this, in some ways, make me partially responsible for any potential new victims of my previous partners acts of rape and sexual violence? 

I would love other women’s thoughts on this. What responsibility do we have to protect each other, if any at all? And is this responsibility tied to the justice system? 

I am in Australia for context but believe this is relevant to any democratic justice system that does not criminalise the victims of rape themselves. 

TLDR: if we do not report those who commit acts of rape and sexual violence to us, does this make us partially responsible for future victims’ suffering? Does our silence reflect complicity and have we in turn failed to protect fellow women?

UPDATE
Thanks to all the women who shared their replies. This train of thought was actually sparked by the Epstein Netflix documentary Filthy Rich. Seeing those women be so brave and realising it was their persistence to testify and charge the bastard that (would’ve) put him away was powerfully thought provoking. 
I agree that women aren’t responsible or complicit, though I will clarify that by complicit I meant less directly involved and more, by being silent, we don’t actively protect or defend others. Stories like Epstein’s victims can trigger these thoughts, particularly in survivors (like me). I think it’s important we talk about it as a community though. And, maybe if we keep talking about sexual assault and rape and putting pressure on the systems that make laws around these crimes, it will one day be considered valuable and useful to report them",2020-06-07

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

It should be harmless, but since it hurts, I'll have to get it removed. Because I'm very young and have a family history of early breast cancer, they're kinda rushing it and I'll have it removed in the next few weeks. Now, they removed some tissue yesterday to find out what kind of tumour it is and whether it is truly not cancerous. Afterwards, it hurt a lot more than I expected and I can't walk around without a bra at the moment, because it hurts every time my boobs move. I'm a bit afraid of the surgery now...

Has anyone had a tumour removal? How fast does it heal? Is the scar very visible afterwards? What do I have to expect?

UPDATE: Just came home from the hospital. Everything went fine. I had the surgery at 9:30am or so, and I already feel so much better than a few hours ago. Still a bit high on painkillers and stuff though. Also, it turned out to be a fibroadenoma and not a lipoma like I thought at first.",2020-06-20

Reddit's new content policy and associated banwave Megathread,46,42,"Good Morning

Reddit admin /u/spez has released their new content policy.  You can see it posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/).  We recommend that everyone take a minute to read it.

Due to this content policy, over 2,000 subreddits have been banned, including /r/The_Donald, /r/ChapoTrapHouse, and /r/GenderCritical.

As a mod team, we decided to give you all a place to discuss these happenings.  However, keep two things in mind:

1. While this is an open discussion thread, all subreddit rules will still be enforced.  Our tolerance levels for hate speech will be zero.

2. It is still the official policy of this sub that trans women are women, and trans men are men.  Full stop.  We will abide no discussion to the contrary.

Happy Thersday!,18,0,"

Thersday is a day for questions focusing on women and women's experiences only. No questions related specifically about men/male behaviors will be permitted on Thursdays. This includes questions   
about women's thoughts on men's words, appearances, actions, or anything else related to men. Everyone is welcome to participate in Thersday regardless of your own gender, but questions should remain 
focused on women and their experiences and opinions.  Thersdays will run from 12am ET Thursday to 12am ET Friday.

 Examples of things we'll remove:

* What do you think of men who x?

* How does it make you feel when men x?

* What are your best/worst experiences with men?

* If a man does x, how would you react?

If you have any questions about these supplemental rules, please message the moderators and we will be happy to discuss it with you.

Edit 2: For all of those saying they are baffled that this type of anxiety exists, please understand that irrational anxieties like this are conditioned or part of other underlying mental health issues.

Casual Convo Fridays.,12,64,"
Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Happy Thersday!,12,5,"

Thersday is a day for questions focusing on women and women's experiences only. No questions related specifically about men/male behaviors will be permitted on Thursdays. This includes questions   
about women's thoughts on men's words, appearances, actions, or anything else related to men. Everyone is welcome to participate in Thersday regardless of your own gender, but questions should remain 
focused on women and their experiences and opinions.  Thersdays will run from 12am ET Thursday to 12am ET Friday.

 Examples of things we'll remove:

* What do you think of men who x?

* How does it make you feel when men x?

* What are your best/worst experiences with men?

* If a man does x, how would you react?

If you have any questions about these supplemental rules, please message the moderators and we will be happy to discuss it with you.

Casual Convo Fridays.,10,62,"
Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Casual Convo Fridays.,7,42,"
Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Wow. So I checked this post today and just... overwhelmed by the kindness of all of you. I’m honestly amazed I still have tears to cry but apparently not!

Thankyou everyone for making me feel less alone right now. I’ve felt like many didn’t understand or made me feel “over the top” for feeling like I’m losing a member of my family. He was the only one there in some of my darkest times, being accountable and caring for him gave me purpose to get out of bed and eventually I could care for myself too.

Ah writing this is not helping the crying situation haha. But I’m taking the advice many shared of knowing the full and life full of love I was able to give him and all the memories. 

As to saying goodbye, he was able to be given a sedative and the injection to put him to sleep at home which I’m so thankful for. And we’re going to bury him at his favourite place with his favourite tree.

I wrote this question after feeling upset by a coworker making me feel bad about my emotions “especially with  actual people dying from Covid” ugh... but now I feel like it’s okay to feel my grief. And soon it will get better.

Thankyou everyone, so much.",2020-09-04

*Not something I am currently facing, thank goodness, but I stumbled upon a social media account today solely for a baby who was born severely disabled. It made me pose questions to myself, as well as wonder about the ethics of such a decision. The baby’s life looks remarkably painful (to me, admittedly as an outsider) and her parents are open about their choice to forgo abortion even though they knew this was their unborn child’s fate at a very early stage. As someone who has NEVER had to make such a tough decision, I am just curious about others’ perspectives.*",2020-09-06

He has never been physically abusive and maybe a month ago I would say he wasn’t abusive at all. However, I’m beginning to notice some gas lighting/emotional manipulation which has just left me utterly depressed and self conscious.
I’m shocked because I have a history of abusive relationships and I can’t believe it took me this long to realize that I might be in one. -still not really sinking in because I didn’t think it was intentional for the longest time. It’s hard to explain.
I wasn’t expecting so many responses and I appreciate everyone of you. Some of these stories are kind of triggering however, so I apologize if I don’t respond. But you all are absolute bad asses and I’m so proud to hear your stories.

I don’t make enough money to afford our current apartment but I also can’t afford the $2,400 to break the lease and on top of that cover a down payment for a new apartment. I was jobless for a bit due to covid and totally depleted my savings.

My plan was to break up with him when our lease was up in May, however, COVID happened *and* his best friend died unexpectedly literally the day I was planning to move out. I still love him and couldn’t let him go through that alone.

Thank you for the food for thought. I have a lot to think about right now.

Casual Convo Fridays.,9,46,"
Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Happy Thersday!,8,0,"

Thersday is a day for questions focusing on women and women's experiences only. No questions related specifically about men/male behaviors will be permitted on Thursdays. This includes questions   
about women's thoughts on men's words, appearances, actions, or anything else related to men. Everyone is welcome to participate in Thersday regardless of your own gender, but questions should remain 
focused on women and their experiences and opinions.  Thersdays will run from 12am ET Thursday to 12am ET Friday.

 Examples of things we'll remove:

* What do you think of men who x?

* How does it make you feel when men x?

* What are your best/worst experiences with men?

* If a man does x, how would you react?

If you have any questions about these supplemental rules, please message the moderators and we will be happy to discuss it with you.

Casual Convo Fridays.,10,60,"
Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

* **Dismissive-avoidant**: they may appear not to care too much about close relationships, and may prefer not to be too dependent upon other people or to have others be too dependent upon them
* **Anxious-preoccupied**:  they worry that others may not love them completely, and be easily frustrated or angered when their attachment needs go unmet
* **Fearful-avoidant** (a.k.a., disorganized): lives in an ambivalent state of being afraid of being both too close to or too distant from others. They attempt to keep their feelings at bay but are unable to; they can't just avoid their anxiety or run away from their feelings

I was very moved by a lot of the experiences you shared and it makes me feel a lot happier knowing that I'm definitely not the only person who has had to deal with stuff like this.

Some of you have been asking for more information about my personal experience, but unfortunately due to the rules of this subreddit I don't think I'm allowed to go into specific details.
However, I was thinking of posting my experience in detail on the r/relationshipadvice subreddit and asking for advice on there, so if people would be interested in seeing that I can let you know and maybe link to it when I post?

Again thanks for all the responses and I'm so glad I recently chose to download reddit because the solidarity between so many people on here is beautiful.

Casual Convo Fridays.,7,78,"
Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

"If you were forced into a marriage and had children, how do you imagine you would feel about them?",860,230,"This is inspired by Overly Sarcastic Productions's folkloric Animal Brides video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS62iRXBeJc

In it, one of the grim pieces of folklore is that a man saw a seal turn into a woman, stole her seal skin, and forced her into marriage with children. Eventually she gets her skin back and escapes. 

Now I know the storytelling/characterization of myths is inherently vastly different from how real people would react to these hypotheticals and that this situation is uncomfortably close to real life ordeals and shouldn't be made light of, but I can't help a curiosity about how real people would feel in that situation.",2021-01-01

2 Million Subscribers,1645,355,"Hello! This week we did something I don't think any of us ever planned or expected - AskWomen has reached 2 million subscribers. 

To celebrate, we wanted to do something different and (hopefully) lighthearted and create an opportunity for us to get to know each other in a direct and personal manner. A chance to see the human behind the screen, so to speak. Obviously we're not going to dox ourselves, but we'd love to discuss with the community a little bit about our experiences as mods, how we have navigated the past 10 years, and ideally, share and discuss some of the truly weird and wild stuff we have seen (and filtered) since 2010.

The format of this topic will be for you to ask questions to mods as a group. Meta questions about specific rules/guidelines/policies, or individual experiences should still be directed to [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskWomen) and as always, questions must fit within the [rules of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/rules).

How would you take it if someone figured out your menstrual cycle through observation?,0,27,"I'm might be a little dumb regarding this topic so I might get a few things wrong. Feel free to correct me but please don't hate.

I watched Community's S2E8 (Cooperative Calligraphy; great episode, one of the best; solid 10) where Abed Nadir, a character who has difficulty with social skills (possibly has Asperger's syndrome) tries to better his behaviour with 3 ladies in his group. In charting their behaviour to identify a pattern, he figures out what's truly happening and adjusts his lifestyle accordingly to help them. When they find out, one seems impressed, another violated (feels like her privacy is invaded) and the 3rd felt shocked, ig.

Abed did this unknowingly. He tried to understand it from a scientific perspective but found something else. But his adjustment to their behaviour did make things a little better for the group (his words, not mine).

This bought up a few things in my mind.

First, do you even think this is possible? (I'm aware that cycles cause mood swings but with the little research I did, I couldn't find any info on charting them from behaviour). Obviously, 100% verification isn't possible w/o asking the lady herself but do you think it's possible to get it accurate.

Second, how would you feel if someone (m/f friend) did this with the intention of making life easier for you (i.e. they'd do this with the purpose of finding your menstrual cycle so that they could help you since they understand your struggle)?

Note: I've no intention of doing this. Just curious here.",2021-02-10

It’s can be difficult to ascertain as it’s done unintentionally or very subtle and not in clearly neglectful or abusive households but those with two parents, high achievers/earners or families that provide children with fundamental needs (food clothing shelter).

Some signs: 
* Feeling empty
* Low self esteem or self worth
* Fear of dependency on others
* Not trusting kindness from others, believing they want something from you 
* Fearing emotional intimacy or emotionally unavailable 
* Needing constant reassurance 
* Unrealistic self image 
* No self compassion but shows high amounts for others 
* Feeling Guilty, anger and shame for reacting or feeling certain emotions 
* Difficulty feeling, expressing or managing emotions

I think this is a good show of support for women who choose to wear the Hijab, and a good way to show bigots that their anti-Muslim behaviour will not be tolerated.

I've also seen accounts of both Muslim and ex-Muslim women who say they don't want to wear a Hijab but are compelled to by their families, or their communities.

My question is: Would you support them by participating in World No-Hijab Day, in order to show bigots that they should not have control over a woman's body nor make her do things she does not want to (either physical force, social pressure, or any form of verbal coercion)?

If yes, how do you think your family / social group would react? And how would you support them (would you remove your own for a day)?

With the exception of physical abuse- I agree no one should remain with the abuser! 

When is it worth all the hurt that comes with cutting off a parent(s) When is working through it or forgiving and forgetting not enough? Who’s job is it to see through emotional traumas and have compassionate relationship and still maintain healthy boundaries? Is that even possible?

Edit: thank you to everyone who took the time to share their stories and perspectives. I’ll try to respond individually. 

Full disclosure: I have not nor intend to cut off my parents-but I am seeing this play out between a cousin and their parent and I am close with both of them and see the hurt it has caused and the  pattern of “cutting off” as a manipulative tactic in that family dynamic. 

But finding out the true reasons from my cousin and some of my recent realizations of the toxic emotional baggage that is part of that side of my family’s generations of trauma- I understand why my cousin did it- though personally I have found other ways ( distance- calling it out- refusing to be manipulated) to cope and still have a loving relationship with my family.",2021-03-16

I asked this question because whenever I see a strong, positive father/daughter relationship in TV/movies/books, I genuinely wonder if there are real fathers like that. Especially when a dad has a sappy, emotional, supportive, loving speech, I always wonder if dads actually speak that way to their daughters in real life.

It makes me happy knowing that there are daughters in the world who think happy thoughts when they think of their dad.",2021-05-23

Same thing happened when I started working out, and I get questions from people who've just started knitting and hit similar barriers, so I think it's a common problem with trying to teach yourself something through impersonal resources.

"Update: Supplementary rules for Thersday here to stay, a clarification regarding our disrespectful commentary rule, and a THANK YOU!",281,49,"Hey everyone! Hope your June is off to a fine start. We're here with some notes and updates about moderation policy. Without further delay:

# Thersday

You suggested and we listened: you wanted a day free of motherhood, parenting, pregnancy, and similar related posts! In response, we expanded our theme day, Thersday, to limit posts only to women themselves, outside of any relationships with other people. It was initially implemented as a trial, and we are happy to announce that due to good feedback, this change is here to stay. We’re pleased with the creativity and variety of topics posted as a result of theme days, and as far as we can tell, so are you!

# An important clarification regarding our rule against disrespectful commentary

At AskWomen, we strive to be an inclusive space. Statistically, approximately 1 in 5 adults will experience some form of mental illness in their lifetime. As we grow as a subreddit, we want to maintain a space where we can both include and be understanding of one another. As such, we are expanding this policy to now include pathologizing language/armchair diagnosing. We feel that, whether intentional or not, casual use of diagnostic labels to describe everyday behaviour can exclude and be harmful to people experiencing mental illness.

It is not fair to people with mental illness to attribute every feeling or action to their condition, particularly the choice to abuse. Plenty of people living with mental illnesses are capable of living a life free of abusing others, just as some abusers who have no known psychiatric conditions make the conscious choice to abuse, every day.

In short, we are asking our community to **avoid using terms for mental health issues as judgments, slurs, or synonyms for toxic behaviour.** Posts and comments will be encouraged, where possible, to use non-pathologizing/clinical adjectives to describe traits/behaviours.

# Examples of using these terms as judgements, slurs, or careless casual use

**Usage of words/labels like:**

* “OCD” (to mean something like fastidious, particular, picky, fussy)
* “narcissist” (to mean something like self-absorbed, arrogant, toxic, selfish, abusive)
* “borderline/BPD” (to mean something like unstable, unpredictable, moody)
* ""schizo’’ (to mean something like paranoid, erratic, or eccentric)
* “ADHD” (to mean something like hyperactive, jittery, inattentive)
* “psycho(path)’’ or ""sociopath’’ (to mean something like angry, jealous, controlling, abusive...) and similar.

If a diagnostic label can be replaced by another word, it must be used instead. In our experience, the more common synonyms might be ""abuser’’/’’abusive’’, ""toxic (of a behaviour or person)’’, or ""asshole’’. You always have your pick of non-gendered slurs and insults, too!

**Armchair diagnostics or speculation about possible diagnoses:**

* **‘**’That sounds like x’’,
* ""I think my ex was y""
* ‘’I think my mom has/is z’’

**Exceptions:**

* Talking about your own, diagnosed condition and how it affects you
* Talking about your family member, friend, or other person with a diagnosed condition, and how it affects you, in a submission in which you are the requested demographic (eg. addressed to friends/family members of people with x, not people with x).
* Talking about yourself/someone in your life who is seeking a diagnosis, but does not have one yet (eg - ""my friend is starting the process of getting tested for ADHD"")
* Talking about famous people and figures who have the diagnosis, if it is relevant

Application of these rules is at moderator discretion. We may remove other common labels or descriptors (for instance ""crazy"") if mods feel that they were used in a blatantly disrespectful manner. Please[ send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskwomenmods) if you would like to discuss a removed comment or post.

We know that the use of some of these labels is very common on Reddit, so it's natural that some of these terms might be used by accident. Please know that a request to edit your post does not mean that you are in trouble; fix it and we will be happy to put it back up! We process too much content to pay attention to usernames, so please be assured that it's not some kind of mark against you as a participant :)

# You're the best!

With all that out of the way, we love being part of such an active, caring community. By reporting rule-breaking content, upvoting good questions, and downvoting only when content is in bad faith or does not contribute meaningfully to the community, you help out more than you can know. **Please continue to do an excellent job being excellent to each other, and thank you!**",2021-06-05

Vaginal odor question and how to solve it?,2,5,"Hi ladies! Hoping to get some kind of insight as Google has failed me.

Starting around early March I started to notice my smell changing. Not just my sweat and pee, but vagina smell as well. 

At this time I started a new anti-anxiety medicine (Hydroxyzine), a plain dove body wash, and began smoking weed and CBD daily again. I also eat garlic and onion regularly (and if it’s isn’t obvious, I am single 😂)

Please note I had COVID early December and lost my sense of smell and taste for at least a month. Even though I recovered by January, I have felt like my senses have been off since.

The smell was very earthy like CBD and I wondered if my consistent use was part of the problem, but haven’t been able to find anything online about it. 

First, I weened off the body wash. It took me until May to do this because at first I thought my senses were off, then I thought it was the smoking (haven’t weened off), and I realized the earthy smell was coming from the Dove body wash. It had no “scent” on the bottle (“Dove deep moisture skin-natural nourishers”). After I stopped using it I stopped smelling that earthy smell everywhere (such a relief).

Now however I am still noticing my scent and taste buds are off when I eat, and a weed/onion smell has permeated my urine, sweat, and lady bits. Maybe it’s because of the onions I just ate, BUT even before that I feel like I have been particularly fragrant down there (and unfortunately not in a sexy way).

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this, and if so, what helped change your natural scent to be better? Thank you!",2021-06-24

Given the large amount of breast surgery questions we've been getting, we thought it's best to catch them all in one post for easier finding!

What is your opinion on the sexual harassment lawsuits in Activision?,4,14,"[https://www.cnet.com/news/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-walkout-ceo-response-and-everything-you-need-to-know/](https://www.cnet.com/news/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-walkout-ceo-response-and-everything-you-need-to-know/)

&#x200B;

 

When dozens of Activision Blizzard employees [staged a walkout on Wednesday](https://www.cnet.com/news/activision-blizzard-walkout-organizers-demand-change-amid-ceos-response-to-lawsuit/) it was the latest update in a troubling week for the company behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. Activision Blizzard has been rocked by [an explosive lawsuit filing last week](https://www.cnet.com/news/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-frat-boy-workplace-culture/) when the state of California accused it of workplace discrimination against its female workforce. 

The suit, [filed by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing](https://aboutblaw.com/YJw), argues that the company has a ""frat boy"" workplace culture and alleges several alarming incidents of discrimination and harassment.

  

Activision Blizzard is accused of workplace discrimination. It alleges women are compensated unfairly -- paid less for the same job, scrutinized more heavily than their male peers -- and subject to considerable harassment. The agency called Activision Blizzard a ""breeding ground for harassment and discrimination,"" in which women are subject to regular sexual advances by (often high-ranking) men who largely go unpunished.  

Illustrative of the claims DFEH is making against Activision is an office ritual referred to as ""cube crawls,"" in which men allegedly drink ""copious"" amounts of alcohol, crawl through the office cubicles and engage in ""inappropriate behavior"" including groping. The lawsuit describes incidents including allegations that a female employee died by suicide during a business trip as a result of a toxic relationship with a supervisor.

It’s come up a few times but if you’re in a bad way about this, pls consider focusing on yourself and genuinely enjoying yourself as your primary.

Edit3: I’m not looking for advice on this lol just curious about other women’s thoughts concerning this phenomenon.

Edit4: at now about 400~ comments I may not see your comment. Just know I’m wishing you the best, I see you and hear you and hope you find a transformative love that holds and nourishes you. It’s hard never or rarely being considered for a romantic connection, I hope it doesn’t shape you and deter you from believing love is real, it is powerful, there’s nothing wrong with desiring it, and that you deserve it💕

Edit5: I should have said this earlier but this is not something « all women » face. While all women are sexualized, many get asked on dates, wined and dined, committed to/married and generally romanced; there is a category of women who do not get the opportunity to even be considered for those romantic gestures at all.

How/When should I tell her I never had sex?,1,0,"Hello, I am 28 years old guy who did not have sex before. why? I had a relationship when I was younger but my ex girlfriend did not want to have until we're engaged /soon to be married / married, and I totally respected that, then after we broke up I focused more on my studies, career, financial investments, hobbies...,  and did not pay attention that I am getting old and did not have sex yet.  


Currently I am seeing this girl, she is 23 and she had sex before (FWB situation), but she's never been in a serious relationship before. She is a great person that I really don't want to mess up things with ( even if our relation does not work out, i don't wanna lose her as a friend).  


I am under stress right now and become very nervous when I think when should I and how should I tell her (Because I will, I don't like the idea of deceiving/tricking someone into something they don't wanna). Should I tell her when we're about to have sex, or when the topic arises? I really hope she asks me and get done with this stress.  


I am not nervous of having sex itself, I know I will not be as good as any experienced man but I will learn and practice makes perfect.  


BTW, I am not ashamed or something of not having sex till now, because It was my decision after all (I do have some regrets)and I have a good career and in general I am successful. And also not afraid of her telling me no, because it is nothing personal and it might  just be her preference at the moment, but afraid that things might be complicated and lose her.  


Thanks in advance. 😊",2021-09-05

with more normal like 20 or 40 denier, maybe 60... I am not really convinced. In the city  
I live it's cheaper to get a pair of tights than a can of Monster. I think it's feasible to just  
wear them once to the concert and throw them out, even buy a new pair every day.
