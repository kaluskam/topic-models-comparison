Seeking a gingerbread recipe that will knock my socks into another dimension,"A bit of backstory: in middle school, right before winter break, our history/English teacher had us make a colonial (?) gingerbread loaf recipe in class. I don‚Äôt have that recipe, and the teacher has since retired. I remember it being so, so good, and I began thinking about gingerbread again this fall as the weather began to turn. I love it, but I have never been able to recreate the rapture. 

I‚Äôve tried a few recipes for gingerbread lately and found them to be quite lackluster: too dry, too light, too bland. Does anyone have a recipe for gingerbread that meets the following criteria?

A) Is very moist. 

B) Is very aromatic and flavorful. 

C) Is loaf- or cake-style. No cookies.

D) Will knock my socks off into another dimension (is very good!)

Yes, I could easily try google, and continue to work my way through innumerable options but I‚Äôm kind of tired of buying water towers worth of molasses and my family is getting sick of mediocre gingerbread. So if you‚Äôve got one squirreled away somewhere, help me out! Let my tireless quest come to an end!",2019-10-08

The Most Delicious Butter Chicken Masala Recipe I've Ever Had,"About 6 months ago I had wanted to try something new and something I had never tried to cook before. I didn't even know what Butter Chicken WAS. 


I have never been a fan of Indian food in the few experiences I've had with it, and as a result I have not experimented very much. So this was very much out of my comfort zone. 


I can NOT get over how delicious this recipe in particular was. My husband is extremely picky as well and both of our plates are licked clean.


INGREDIENTS


FOR THE CHICKEN MARINADE


1¬†pound¬†boneless, skinless chicken breast, cubed into 1"" cubes


2¬†tablespoons¬†tandoori paste


1¬†teaspoon¬†grated ginger


2¬†cloves¬†garlic, minced


1¬†teaspoon¬†chili powder


1 1/2¬†tablespoon¬†coriander powder


1 1/2¬†teaspoon¬†ground cumin


1/2¬†teaspoon¬†garam masala


1/2¬†cup¬†plain greek yogurt


FOR THE REST OF THE DISH


2-4¬†tablespoons¬†unsalted butter


1¬†onion, sliced or diced


1: 14.5¬†ounce¬†can crushed tomatoes


1/2¬†cup¬†heavy cream


Salt and pepper, to taste


Pinch of cayenne for extra heat, optional


INSTRUCTIONS


Place the cubed chicken into a large resealable plastic bag. Then whisk the remaining ingredients for the marinade in a bowl and pour into plastic bag. Seal then using your hands, massage and mix the chicken until all is coated with the marinade. Marinade for 6-8 hours or overnight.


When ready, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and melt the butter in the skillet.


Once the butter is melted, add the onion. Cook until the onions are tender, about 3-5 minutes.


Add the bag of chicken and the marinade into the skillet. Stir to incorporate then pour the tomatoes in. Stir to combine.


Cook uncovered on medium heat until it comes to a simmer and until the chicken is cooked through, about 10-15 minutes.


Add the heavy cream, stir to incorporate and simmer for an additional 5 minutes.


Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add cayenne if you want more heat.


Serve over basmati rice and with naan!



Please give it a shot. So simple to make and WORTH the overnight marinating.",2019-10-10

Looking for a good 'green chicken chili' recipe,"I love chili and make it a couple of times a month during the fall and winter months, but it gets redundant after a while so I like to switch things up. I love a good green chicken chili. Years ago I worked in a hospital, and the chef in the cafeteria was a cool (and extremely heavy) guy who made some really good stuff (for instance, I learned about mixing ranch dressing with bbq sauce and making the best-tasting damn salad topping I've ever had ‚Ä¶ well, for a bbq chicken salad, anyway). He made this green chicken chili one time that was the best.  Don't laugh‚Äîyes, it was a hospital cafeteria, but I'm telling you this stuff was perfect.  That poor guy eventually got fired, and I've been trying to duplicate his recipe ever since.

I've tried a few recipes, but they tend to come out with the flavors not melded together very well, and often with a consistency that is more like soup than chili.  So, specifically, I'd like something that meets these criteria:

\-It should include salsa verde, perhaps a hatch chile sauce, or even require fresh-made from tomatillos

\-It should have a slightly thick/creamy consistency. I notice most recipes include cream cheese, and that's fine, but the overall color should come out somewhat green. And I don't mean green *broth*‚ÄîI don't want to make soup.

\-White beans (cannellini, navy, whatever), and maybe some other kind of darker bean for contrast. Corn is usually good in this dish as well.  Definitely some canned green chiles, and maybe some chopped jalapeno. 

I guess this is really about a recipe for the liquid portion of the chili. Once I have that, beans or whatever else can be added. Cilantro and cheese topping can be added per serving. I'll add that I'm an Instant Pot user, so I'd be amenable to trying an IP recipe, but shortcuts like that aren't the most important thing here. When I make my red chili, I like it to simmer most of the day, and in the interest of getting the flavors to blend I'd happily do the same for a good green chicken chili.  

Hoping someone out there has what I'm looking for. Thanks!",2019-10-10

Lovett-Inspired Pork Pies with Coriander Gravy,"Right, I've been working on a pork pie inspired by Sweeney Todd for a few months now and finally got around to making it.

Sweetener of choice

Meat Filling:
1 lb of ground pork (70/30 or 73/27. Alternatively, combine cuts of shoulder, belly, and bacon and grind together thrice)
1 large baking potatoes
1 large onion, minced
2 tsp minced coriander leaves
1 tbsp toasted coriander seeds (optionally, ground)
1 dash ground allspice
¬Ω tsp ground black or white pepper
1 tsp salt 
¬Ω tsp ground cinnamon
¬º tsp of ginger
¬º tsp of cumin
¬Ω or 1 tsp of chili powder
Corn Starch
Water

Optionally: 1 dash each of rosemary and/or thyme

Gravy
1 whole bunch of coriander leaves, chopped. 
1 Tomato, cubed. 
1-3 green chillies. 
10-15 cashew nuts. 
1 cup of milk. 
1 tsp of red chilli powder. 
1-2 potatoes, diced (optional). \
1 tsp of cumin
2 tsp of 5 spice (optional)
Salt to taste.


Dough: 
Grease, then flour cupcake tins. 
Add 4 cups of all purpose flour to ¬æ cups of softened butter, ¬æ cups of shortening and 1 teaspoon of salt. Gradually add ice water and work into a shaggy ball. Wrap in plastic and put in fridge for 15-20 minutes. After refrigerating, take out and halve. Roll each half out with a floured dour or rolling pin, then place over cupcake tin - using a second tin to gently push it inwards. Afterwords, trim and shape so that the dough is shaped to the inside of each tin mold. Combine and rollout remaining dough. 

Glaze: Combine herb butter of choice with sweetener of choice (for example, honey) in ratio of 1 part sweetener to 4 parts herb butter. Lightly glaze pies after removal from tin.

Gravy
1. Wash coriander leaves three or four times, then chop them. Put chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, tomato, cashew, and a half glass of milk into a blender and mix until it's a fine paste. Keep aside. 
2. Peel potato skins and dice. 
3. Heat oil and fry potatoes until they turn light brown, then remove from heat. Dry and cool. 
4. Heat 4 tsp oil in pan, then add cumin and lightly roast. Add the paste and let boil for 5 minutes.
5. Add in the remaining milk. If too thick, add an additional ¬Ω cup of water. Let boil for an additional 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
6.  Add in salt and 5 spice. Cook for an additional 2 minutes, adding water as needed. Add potatoes. Cook for 1-2 more minutes, stirring constantly.

Meat Filling
Grind meats if needed. Bake potato until done, 30-45 minutes in an oven at 400 degrees F.
Peel and mash the potato.
Place ground pork into large skillet or pan - over medium/medium-high heat -  and begin to brown. Water may be necessary depending on fat content.  Stir frequently to avoid sticking or clumping.
Once browned (approx. 30 minutes), add in the potato, onion, and cilantro. Once mixed in, add water as necessary followed by the spices. Stir occasionally.
Add mixture of cornstarch and water to thicken as necessary, let simmer as necessary.

Pour in meat filling, leaving ¬º inch of room near the top.

After pouring in meat filling, cut out circles (using a glass, as an example) to top each, crimping with a fork to seal. Lightly brush over the tops with an egg wash.

Cook for 45-60 minutes at 350 F.

After cooking, gingerly remove and let cool as needed. Add glaze, then serve with gravy as side (if served with potatoes) or for dipping.",2019-10-11

Slow cooker chili suggestions??,"So, I have a basic recipe for chili that I follow (basically what I found trying to duplicate Wendy‚Äôs), and it‚Äôs good, but I want great. Please let me know what would improve this recipe:

~2 lb ground beef
~4 stalks celery, chopped
2-3 onions, chopped
3 green peppers, chopped 
2 28oz cans crushed tomatoes 
1 can diced tomatoes (or rotel)
1 can tomato sauce (14oz)
2 cans kidney beans
1 can chili beans (mixed beans)
1 packet chili seasoning (trying Stubb‚Äôs Chili Fixins Cookin‚Äô Sauce this time)
~1 cup water (I changed this to beef broth)
2 Tbsp white vinegar 
2 Tbsp brown sugar 
Salt and pepper to taste 

Directions: brown ground beef, break into crumbles and brown some more. Add beef to crockpot, then basically add remaining ingredients (except vinegar, that goes in at the end), then add seasoning and broth, cover and cook in slowcooker >8 hours (usually ends up cooking about 12 hours. 

So...I heard adding a beer would be ideal, but I don‚Äôt drink beer and have no idea what type would be best. Anything else I should add or do to improve the chili? Is it better to use prepared chili seasoning or try to make my own? I have the spices but don‚Äôt know the quantities. Thanks in advance for your help!",2019-10-11

"No-prep, one-pan EASY holiday recipes for seniors?","Hello everyone! I work with an organization that visits apartment complexes,  nursing homes, etc. to put on events for senior citizens. This holiday season we'd like to do events where seniors can make small batches of holiday meal side dishes (classics like green bean casserole, stuffing, etc.) that they can take home and either cook or freeze. (No cooking will be done on-site.) We will give them a recipe card and an aluminum foil pan at each station. I am looking for recipes or modifications to recipes that will allow for the following: 

\- Ideally, no ingredients that have to be frozen or refrigerated BEFORE the event (we have no storage space for this). Refrigerating the recipe after the event is fine.  

\- recipes that produce very few dirty dishes - ideally we'd love them to basically be able to pour everything into the dish we give them. We want to avoid lots of mixing and measuring as we don't have a good way to clean dirty dishes after

\- recipes that require little or no prep (especially no cutting.) We don't have a food license so we can't prep the food for them and we don't want a participant to hurt themselves or make the dish taste bad because they don't know what they're doing! 

Thank you for any guidance you guys can provide! We are hoping to make this a fun and worthwhile event for some seniors this winter.",2019-10-11

ZUCCHINI RIPIENI," Hi everyone!

Today I was talking with a friend about vegetables, vegetarian dishes and trying to get children eating veggies and I thought I'd share it with you my personal recipe of Zucchini ripieni - Stuffed zucchini...my nonna used to add salsiccia because at that time nobody was a vegetarian though ü§î

To make 4 servings you need 4 zucchini, 2 cups of ricotta cheese, 1 red onion, 1 cup of tomato sauce, salt, pepper, oregano, evo oil.

Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise and dig the pulp, I use a digger from Tescoma Italia  (it's very durable and can be washed in the dishwasher üòâ). Thinly slice the onion and saut√© in a pan together with the pulp of zucchini a little evo oil, salt and pepper. Mix it with the ricotta and fill the zucchini. Season with tomato sauce on top and a sprinkling of oregano. Bake for 30 min at 350¬∞F(170¬∞C).

If you like a stronger flavor you can add Parmesan to the dough, but watch out for the salt because the Parmesan is already quite salty!

If someone tries the recipe, please let me know if you like it!",2019-10-12

"Poor planning and a potted plant addiction led to more peppers than we know what to do with, and we could use some help.","We have a single habanero plant and two jalapeno plants that have been doing very well on our porch, but now we have a problem - we never actually had any plans as far as what we were going to do with the peppers, and we've just now discovered just how many peppers a single plant is capable of putting out. 

We have about 70 grams of habaneros and another 70 of jalapenos, with lots more still ripening. We thought about making pepper jelly, but the recipes we've found only call for a few peppers, and yet if we were to scale up the recipe to compensate, we'd quickly run out of storage space for the final product.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 tbsp Sugar
* ¬† 3 tbsp Milk
* ¬† 300 g flour
* ¬† 2 tbsp Cocoa
* ¬† 3 eggs
* ¬† 23 tbsp Vegetable oil
* ¬† Salt - a pinch

**Cooking:**

1. Beat eggs with salt and sugar. Cook the dough better in a blender: it will turn out quickly and efficiently, the dough is uniform, without lumps.

2. Then pour a glass of milk into the mixture and beat again. Pour flour, beat so that there are no lumps left. Continuing to beat, gradually pour the remaining milk into the dough. You should have a fairly thin batter.

3. Now you can bake pancakes. The dough should be in different colors. Therefore, pour a third of the test into a separate container - this is to create patterns for future pancakes. In the rest, add cocoa and mix very well to make the dough uniform, without lumps.

4. Heat the pan well, pour in a little oil, evenly distribute in the pan and heat. Pour in a little dough, literally ¬Ω a scoop and distribute throughout the pan. A little bake. Use a teaspoon to draw a little dough and draw arbitrary patterns on pancakes. Then turn the pancake and fry on the other side.

5. Remove from heat, roll them upside down and serve warm, although cold pancakes are also extremely good.

6. When frying chocolate pancakes in milk, vegetable oil should be poured only once, during the frying of the first pancake. After the oil, you can not add, pancakes do not stick.",2019-10-20

Pancakes from the 1969 Betty Crocker Cookbook,"**Ingredients**

* 1 egg
* 1 cup all-purpose flour*
* 3/4 cup milk
* 2 Tbsp shortening, melted, or vegetable oil
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 3 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt

**Method**

Beat egg with hand beater until fluffy; beat in remaining ingredients just until smooth. For thinner pancakes, stir in additional 1/4 cup milk. Grease heated griddle if necessary. (To test griddle, sprinkle with few drops water. If bubbles skitter around, heat is just right.)

Pour about 3 tbsp batter from tip of large spoon or from pitcher onto hot griddle. Cook pancakes until puffed and dry around edges. Turn and cook other sides until golden brown. (To keep pancakes hot, stack on hot plate with paper towels in between.)

Makes about nine 4-inch pancakes.

*If using self-rising flour, omit baking powder and salt.

My mother has owned this cookbook since she was a teenager, and has been making these pancakes for us all our lives. It is honestly the best pancake recipe I‚Äôve tried. Admittedly, some fancier buttermilk pancake recipes (where you whip the egg whites separately, fold them in etc.‚Äîthink those marvelous ones by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt) will be objectively taller and fluffier, but I feel they are not structurally sound enough to handle add-ins like blueberries, bananas, or chocolate chips. Plus, they take more time and more mixing bowls. These pancakes are plenty fluffy (3 tsp of baking powder‚Äôs worth!), super easy, and definitely hold up to add-ins. So for the effort and pay-off, it‚Äôs definitely the best.

I make a double batch (with oil, not shortening), with two mashed bananas folded in, poured with a 1/4 cup measure, and chocolate chips sprinkled on before flipping. And I do always end up adding the extra 1/4 cup milk. It doesn‚Äôt make the pancake ‚Äúthinner,‚Äù as they say; it‚Äôs just what‚Äôs needed to get the batter to the right consistency in my opinion. Just make sure you take the few minutes to get the eggs as fluffy as possible; that makes a big difference.",2019-10-20

does anyone have a good pie crust recipe as well that would be good for a beginner? last time i tried it didnt come out right and i was so discouraged that i just let my kids eat one measuring cup (size: 1/2 cup) of the filling for dessert until it was eventually gone. thank you -michelle.",2019-10-21

Homemade Spaghetti and Meatballs Recipe,"

[**Homemade Spaghetti with Meatballs Source**](https://cookingfrog.com/homemade-spaghetti-and-meatballs-recipe/)

**For the Meatballs**

* Preheat the oven to around 425 F
* Mix the celery, onion and carrot in the food processor. Process it by pulsing so you make a nice pestata texture.
* Pour  the pestata into a large bowl and add the meat, parsley, oregano, eggs,  salt and bread crumbs. Use your hands to mix it nicely and to combine  well.
* Scoop out the mix with the measuring cup so you can take  even portions, and roll the mixture with your hand so make the meatballs
* Place the meatballs on a lined baking sheet. Bake for about 16-19 minutes, or until they are browned nicely. 

 

**For the Spaghetti** 

* Take a large pot, pour the water in and heat to a boiling point.  
* Add the salt. Add pasta to a boiling water and cook for about 10-12  minutes, be careful not to overcook. 
* Save half a cup of pasta water for  later and drain the pasta. 

 

**For the sauce**

* Take a large pot and heat to medium temperature. Pour in olive  oil and add in the onion and garlic. Saute for a few minutes. Pour in  the water from previously cooked pasta and simmer for about 2-3 minutes.
* After  the water has cooked away from the pot, add in red pepper, the bay  leaves and a teaspoon of salt. Cook for about 1-2 minutes and add in the  tomatoes. Take out the canned tomatoes and pout into bowl with 4 cups  of hot water. Add to the pot and bring the sauce to a simmer, and simmer  for about 10 minutes.
* Add the meatballs to a sauce and simmer  by shaking the pan to mix them nicely. Cook until the sauce is thick  enough, it should take about 30 minutes.
* Pour the spaghetti back  to a pot they were cooked in and add the sauce, without meatballs.  Place in the hot bowl and add the meatballs, and more sauce, to your  liking. 

 

#### Ingredients

* **For the meatballs**
* 1 chopped carrot
* 2 chopped stalks celery 
* 1 chopped onion
* Half pound of ground beef, half pound of pork and half pound of ground veal

Do you think there would be away to use honey comb within brownies, (not crunchy) or if that would work well ü§î I‚Äôm not great in the kitchen so thought I‚Äôd ask people with more experience.

Then put:
1 cup of frozen blueberries
2 ripe bananas (if you want less banana flavor, 1 and a half works too)
1 cup non-fat plain Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon of honey
1 teaspoon of vanilla

Recipe Help! We love my Great Grandmother‚Äôs Galette cookies but have such a terrible time making them.,"Recipe: 
1lb butter - melted
12 egg yolks
1/2t salt
1/2 C whipping cream
2T pure vanilla
5C flour
1.5C sugar
2C br. Sugar

Cool butter. Beat yolks until light &thick. Add cream, salt & vanilla. Blend in cooked butter. Mix flour &sugars. Mix liquid & dry ingredients. Chill overnight. Form into small balls and cook on waffle iron.


When we make these they disintegrate. We added 1t of baking powder to the mix years ago and they keep their shape better but it‚Äôs still as if all the butter disappears and leave behind weird crumbles.   We had a special old school waffle iron that was passed down from great grandma that we‚Äôd use for them but it has since vanished, so now I use my waffle maker at home.  I remember having these turn out once while growing up and they were incredible. Mom and I have tried again and again with no luck. (Every couple of years I attempt them again, hopeful that the outcome will be different but without success) It‚Äôs to the point that everyone in the family (aunts, cousins, etc) talks about how much we love them but they‚Äôre too impossible to make. 


My latest attempt I did with the balls preformed and frozen and the waffle iron temp on the lowest setting - same result. 

Any ideas on how to make these work? I‚Äôd love to surprise everyone with them at Christmas!!",2019-10-26
Make Your Mother-in-Law Cry Spicy Sausage and Rice Recipe,"Ha!  Made you look! If you like Hot Italian sausages, then that's as hot as it goes.  Costco was out of their typical Hot Italian Sausages in the meat section, so we bought a package of Evergood brand hot sausage links (12 pack) and used 6 of those (prepped the other half and froze them for next time).

Original recipe is a combo of:

Gordon Ramsays Spicy Sausage and Rice Recipe

Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP6E3JtmsCE

But his video doesn‚Äôt give measurements, so this one does:

https://www.aglugofoil.com/2012/10/spicy-sausage-rice-recipe-gordon-ramsay.html

Kudos to both!

**Note 1:**  We use a 6-quart Dutch oven for stove-top use (made of steel and coated with Teflon; NOT a Le Creuset or such like, which is enameled cast iron and can be used in the oven).

**Note 2:**  You will want to double this for meal prep purposes, but my Dutch oven isn‚Äôt big enough.  Therefore, have everything ready and make 2 batches.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 Tablespoons olive oil

* 1 onion, coarsely chopped (I used a food processor)

* 1 red bell pepper, diced into dime-sized chunks
 
* 1 Tablespoon minced garlic

* 5 hot Italian sausages, casings removed and meat crumbled into small chunks (they were out of their regular hot Italian sausages in the meat section at Costco, so we got pre-packaged ‚ÄúEvergood‚Äù brand hot sausage links (12 pack) - also at Costco - and used 6 of those, removed the casings, and cut into coins.  Then we saved the other 6 sausages in the freezer (casings already removed and cut into coins) = ready for the next time we make this.  Removing the casings takes a lot longer than it looks in the video ~ 10 minutes, but worth it.

* 1 heaping teaspoon smoked paprika

* 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper

* 1/2 teaspoon salt

* 1 cup long-grain rice

* 1/2 cup white wine

* 2 cups chicken stock	

* 1 bunch green onions, chopped

* 1 tomato, diced (I used 1 14.5 oz can diced, roasted tomatoes)

* Small bunch of flat leaf Italian parsley, roughly chopped

**Method:**

* Dutch oven on medium heat (5).

* Add olive oil to Dutch oven and fry the onion for 5 minutes until soft but not colored. 

* Add the red pepper 3 minutes and then minced garlic and cook for 1 minute.

* Increase heat to high.  Add crumbled sausage and cook 4-5 minutes until colored, stirring frequently so it browns well but does not burn.  

**Note:**  I upped the heat to 8.5 for 10 minutes and then upped it to heat level 9 for ~ 8 more minutes.  Next time, increase heat to level 9 from the start here - stirring every few minutes to prevent burning but getting the sausage charred/Maillard effect.

* Add the smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.  Stir.

* While still on high heat, add the rice and stir well. This ""blitzes"" the rice and supposedly is something many restaurants do.

* Add the white wine and deglaze pan by scraping any bits stuck to the bottom. 

* Add the stock and bring to a boil.  

* Reduce heat to a simmer for 15‚Äì20 minutes until the rice is tender and the liquid almost entirely absorbed.  

* Remove from the heat, gently fold in the green onions, tomatoes, and parsley.

I made this in advance because I needed the pot for something else.  It will only get better as the flavors meld!",2019-10-26

Yeast Raised Doughnuts Using Tangzhong Method,"I recently made [this recipe for doughnuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdza8kY0zY) and thought they were great, but they were not quite as pillowy as Krispy Kremes. They also went stale after about a day. To solve this I experimented with using the Tangzhong method. By cooking some the flour and water together it pre-gelatinized the starch and allowed the dough to hold more water. This allowed me to increase the water by a few tablespoons, along with doubling the vanilla. 

I used Instant yeast. Instead of cutting out circles I made squares so I wouldn't have to re-roll the scraps from the cut outs. The dough is very tender so I didn't want to handle it too much. 


***

Yeast Raised Doughnuts Using Tangzhong Method


Follow the recipe below but measure the flour into a bowl and remove 1/3 cup to make the Tangzhong. Add it to a saucepan along with 1 cup of the 1 1/4 cup required. Add about 2 tbsp of water. Cook on medium heat, stirring continuously, till the mixture is smooth and thickens.



***
[Yeast Raised Doughnuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdza8kY0zY)

1 1/4 cups warm water  

1 1/4 tbsp. dry yeast

1 tsp. sugar


1/3 cup sugar

1/4 cup shortening

1 egg, beaten

1/2 tsp. salt

1 tsp. vanilla extract

1/4 tsp. nutmeg

3 1/4 cups all purpose flour

shortening for frying the doughnuts in

Glaze:
2 cups powdered sugar
1/2 tbsp. cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1/2 tsp. vanilla

Add 1 cup of the warm water to the bread machine, reserving 1/4 cup to start the yeast in.  Add the yeast and 1 tsp. of sugar to the reserved water.  Stir to mix well and set aside.  Add the rest of the ingredients to the bread machine and when the yeast has proofed, add it as well.  Set the bread machine on the dough cycle.  When the dough is ready, turn out onto a floured surface and punch down.  Let rest for 10 minutes.  Roll out to 1/2"" thickness and cut out doughnuts.  Place on a very lightly greased and floured baking pan turned upside down.  Lightly cover with plastic wrap and let rise for about 30 minutes or until double in size.  Mix together the glaze ingredients and set aside.  Very carefully remove the doughnuts from the baking pan and drop into a pot or deep fryer full of shortening which has been brought to a temperature of 350 to 360 degrees.  Fry until lightly brown then flip the doughnut over and fry on the other side.  This takes about 1 minute on each side.  Remove the doughnuts from the oil and place on a paper towel to drain.  Dip in glaze while still warm.  Makes about 3 dozen, and this can vary depending on the size of your doughnut cutter, whether or not your doughnuts have holes in them and the thickness you cut the doughnuts.

Note:  I would not substitute anything else for the shortening in this recipe.  You are not likely to get the same results.",2019-10-27

Field to Table Recipe: Lone Star Venison Fajita Skewers,"Recipe
(Serves 4-6)

**Ingrediants**

- 1.5-2 lb. lean venison meat, cut into cubes
- 1 16 oz. can Lone Star Beer
- 2 tsp. kosher salt
- 2 poblano peppers
- 1 white onion
- 3-4 Tbsp. Hardcore Carnivore X Lone Star Meatchelada seasoning

**Tip:** We recommend using metal skewers to avoid the wood skewers burning on the grill.

**Instructions**

1. Place the venison in a bowl, add Lone Star Beer and salt, then cover and marinate in a refrigerator for 30-60 minutes. Do not soak any longer than this.

2. Prepare the poblano peppers by removing the seeds and core and cutting into small squares about 1.5 inches long. Prepare the onion by removing the skin and cutting into squares about 1.5 inches long. 
Drain the venison, then start to assemble the skewers. Alternate onion, poblano, and venison chunks until all skewers have been threaded.

3. Season the skewers well all over with Hardcore Carnivore Meatchelada.

4. Light a grill for high heat cooking, around 450¬∞F.

5. Place the skewers onto the hot part of the grill, and cook, turning every 2 minutes to prevent burning. Cook until the meat has developed a brown crust and the onions and peppers have begun to soften and char, about 10-14 minutes all up. 

6. Remove from grill and serve immediately‚Äîmetal skewers will be hot.

Pastry pie crust made with leafy greens,"All google wants to give me are recipes for spinach quiches and low-carb green crusts, so I need your pie crust expertise!

I'm trying to make some mini Halloween pies that look like they're filled with brains/guts, and I think it would be neat to make the crust green. Because, you know, zombies. I've also got some extra arugula on hand, so I thought it might be neat to blend it up into a puree and put it in the pie crust. Because greens are so watery, I figured I could use them instead of water in my crust. I'm not concerned about clashing flavors here because the filling is crumbled tofu and tomato sauce.

Here's the ingredients in the pie crust normally:
1 1/4c flour
1/4tsp salt
1/2c butter
(Up to) 1/4c water

Do you think this will work? If it will, would it be better to cook the arugula first, or to blend it up raw? Would a roughly 1:1 water:pureed greens substitution work, or could I expect to use substantially more greens?

If the consensus is a no, I'm happy to just use the regular crust, possibly with the addition of green food coloring. It's just that I have leafy greens in my fridge and I think it would taste good!",2019-10-29

[Low Carb Chocolate Muffins With Almond Flour Source](https://cookingfrog.com/low-carb-chocolate-muffins-with-almond-flour/#comment-234)

 Instructions

* Heat up the oven to 350ÀöF. Line a muffin tin with paper liners and set aside for later.
* Take a  medium sized bowl, add the dry ingredients ( baking soda, almond flour,  cacao powder and salt) and blend well to mix.  
* Use another bowl to add eggs, monkfruit sweetener (honey or maple syrup) and melted butter and whisk to mix. 
* Pour the eggs mixture into the almond-flour mixture, then really carefully stir well to blend it nicely. 
* Fold in chocolate chips and divide the batter among the already prepared muffin cups. 
* **This is really**  important part:  fill in every muffin cup three-quarters of the way. It‚Äôs  around 2 and a 0.5 tablespoon per muffin cup.  The dough will be a bit  thick, however it‚Äôll work absolutely perfect.  Sprinkle with extra  sugar-free chocolate to your liking. 
* Bake the muffins for  25-30 minutes, till the tops of the muffins are set and a toothpick  inserted within the center comes out clean. 
* Place the pan on a  wire rack and let the muffins cool within the pan for five minutes.  Gently pop the muffins out let cool for 10 minutes more on the rack.  Enjoy!!!

#### Ingredients

*  2¬º cups of almond flour, i use blanched almond flour 
* 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder

* ¬º teaspoon of salt

Cheez-It Chicken Tenders,"1 cup of Cheez It (or Cheese Nips) crackers

1/2 cup of Townhouse Flipsides Pretztel crackers

1/2 cup Triscuits crackers 

1/2 cup breadcrumbs

1 pack of chicken tender select strips 

1 teaspoon Creole seasoning

1 teaspoon Adobo seasoning

2 bottles of Killian's or Amber Bock beer
(2 cups milk is a great substitute)

2 eggs

2 cups flour

1 can Pam cooking spray

Preheat oven at 350 degrees

*Creating the breading:* Pulverize Cheez-Its, Flipsides and Triscuits in a food processor. Empty crushed crackers into a casserole pan. Mix in the Creole and Adobo seasonings. 

*Preparing your beer batter:* Combine the eggs and beer in a blender; empty into medium size (or larger) mixing bowl.

*Getting your pre-breading ready:* Empty the flour into another pan to allow enough space for properly coating the chicken tenders.

*Breading the Chicken tenders:*
1. Dip the chicken tenders in the beer batter.
2. Roll evenly in flour.
3. Dip in beer batter a second time.
4. Roll in cracker breading until fully coated.

*Bake time:* Lay tenders on sprayed cookie sheet an inch apart and bake 25 minutes. At end of baking time, take one tender and cut into it to see if it is cooked all the way. If still slightly raw, allow to cook for another 5 ‚Äì 10 minutes.

*Serving:* Makes at least 20 tenders, give or take, depending on how many come in each prepackaged container.

It was the best yellow cake I‚Äôve ever had.  It tasted like it was a cross between a Dutch baby and pound cake.  I‚Äôm pretty sure it was a really old pound cake recipe that had been passed down through a family. 

Does anyone have a scratch pound cake recipe that uses, clearly, lots of butter but also uses orange juice as a liquid?  I was told that was the secret.

Request - Pre-Thanksgiving Meal Ideas,"I cook for my brother and his wife, the day before a big family Thanksgiving, when I drive in to visit them. I want to make something exciting and flavourful. The main obstacle is my brother. He has never had a love affair with vegetables. He has gotten better over the years but he hates what he terms as ""mushy"" vegetables (made spaghetti squash with marinara once). Mushy vegetables would include things like squash, spinach and kale as examples. Though he eats some of them raw since I have used them in composed salads I have made. Of course he insists on bottle dressing.

I need some ideas that won't take forever to make, not too many ingredients (not my kitchen) and not real spicy.  Definitely nothing too heavy, or with a lot of starch or any poultry since Thanksgiving is the next day. I am not certain about fish on his scale of likes probably salmon is safe.

"Don't cook, failed at grits, trying to learn the ropes to surprise girlfriend","For the record, I'm a 26 year old dude with no kitchen skills outside of a bbq, and trying to figure out a way to help my girlfriend with dinner every now and then. 

I wish I had a picture of my epic failure. But tonight I got the bright idea I was going to make cheese grits while my girlfriend was out for a few hours. 

I followed the instructions, but my grits came out basically a brick, weren't cooked, and the 2 cups of cheese I used magically disappeared.

Luckily my girlfriend came home just in time for them to explode all over me and the stove and surroundings, and tried fixing what I had done. It was still horrible and only half edible, but the fact I could actually eat it, was incredible and so much more than I had managed to do. 

The box said it would take 30 minutes, but the grits and water solidified in about 2 minutes, and I know for a damn fact I made it NOTHING like I am used to. 

I obviously know the exact taste and texture I'm going for, yet haven't the slightest clue as to how to make it myself üòÇ I now have so much more respect for my mother cooking growing up,and my girlfriend now. 

If anyone has any tips on how to make the most simple thing on earth, I'll love you forever. Even a different recipe that works for you that is different from the one on the box I have would be awesome. 

Thanks!

FYI asking my girlfriend is definitely an option, but I'd love the surprise of her coming home to at least a side dish made by me, the woman deserves it


Edit: thank you everyone for the advice and different things to try! Every single person has been on the same page about how much water to use, and what went wrong for me. Also everyone has made me feel so much better about my embarrassment of not being able to cook that I'm not going to give up. Again, thank you for all of the wonderful tips and advice it means alot!",2019-11-05

While I was travelling in China last month, I bought this strawberry mochi cake/bun from a Lawson store in China (the picture below,  sourced from Google). And I was really amazed by the this combo of cake, cream, fruits all wrapped up with a chewy mochi skin! I truly miss the flavours and the texture when I returned, so I thought I might give it go!

*Formula: Strawberry Mochi Wrap + Fluffy Cake + Whipped Cream + Fresh Strawberries*

[Lawson's original strawberries mochi cake](https://preview.redd.it/h2f84wwfk6x31.jpg?width=1224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0cabc83b9ce9554c062e804bfacf2a8b1edeb0d)

## INGREDIENTS

*Fluffy Cake* \- 

Flour 90g, Baking powder 3g, Oil 20g, Eggs  4, Milk 66g, Sugar 60g

*Strawberry Mochi Skin* \- 

Glutinous Rice Flour 130g, Corn Flour 10g, Sugar 30g, Milk 210g, Strawberry Powder 20g, Butter 15g

Cream - 

Fresh Cream 250g, Icing Sugar 25g

Fresh Strawberries - diced, as much as you like!

## STEPS

**Fluffy Cake**

1. Preheat oven to 160C
2. Separate the eggsAdd oil into the yolks, shake the bowl gently to cover the yolks with oil, mix well
3. Add milk, flour and baking powder (sifted) gradually into the yolks, mix wellBeat egg whites until foamy high speed
4. Add sugar gradually (3 times)
5. Beat egg whites until stiff peak forms, set aside
6. Gentle fold the egg white meringue into the yolk batter (remember to do it gently to get that fluffiness)
7. Spread the batter evenly into a pan, tap to release large air bubbles (I couldn't find my scraper, so I used a spatula, if you have a scraper, you will get nicer surface than I did üòâ)
8. Bake at 160C for 20mins
9. Tap to knock out air inside the cake and set aside to cool

**Strawberry Mochi Wrap**

1. Sift glutinous rice flour and corn flour
2. Add sugar and milk, mix well
3. Microwave the mixture on high heat for 2 mins
4. Gently whisk the mixture, put it back into the microwave for another minute
5. Add in butter, once the butter is melted, mix in with the spongy mochi dough
6. Cool down in fridge

**Cream**

1. Add in icing sugar into cream
2. Beat it until it thickens

\*\*Feel free to add matcha powder/cocoa powder!

**Assembling**

1. Use microwave to heat up (15 secs) some glutinous rice flour as 'hand powder' to prevent sticky-ness when you roll the dough
2. Seperate the mochi dough into smaller size, and roll them out! I used a baking mat with some circle there as a guide, otherwise I might end up rolling them into a giant rectangle shape...lol
3. Lay the mochi wrap over a small bowl, then you put in cream, strawberries and cake
4. Wrap them up!  The mochi wrap is delicate, the thinner you roll it into, easier to break, BUT as long as you wrap it slowly and gently, you will be fine.

Weekend is just around the corner and I hope you all will have fun making this Mochi cake/bun (I still don't know whether I should call it cake or bun üßê) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",2019-11-07

"Question about Recipe Organizers, Paprika 3","Hello, I apologize if this isn't an appropriate place to ask this question.  I am trying to find a recipe organizer that includes an ingredient-based search parameter within personally stored recipes.  I like that many of Paprika 3's features are geared towards personal recipes as opposed to searching for recipes via browser, but I am not sure if it includes the aforementioned ingredient-based search that I mentioned so I would be able to search through all of my stored recipes for a specific ingredient I might have.

Southwestern Chicken Packets,"&#x200B;

[Enjoy!](https://preview.redd.it/9jywzlitjbx31.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37b545169b760ee54cf6e5bffae0f69957aa5074)

Ingredients for 4:

* 21oz/600g chicken breast tenders
* 15oz / 420g canned black beans (1 can)
* 15oz / 420g frozen corn
* 5.5oz / 160g salsa (mild, medium or hot depending on taste)
* 3.5oz / 100g Mexican blend cheese
* 4oz / 120g avocados (1 small piece)
* 3.5oz / 100g sour cream
* 1.5tbsp taco seasoning
* 0.5tsp salt
* 0.25tsp pepper

Instructions:

1. Heat oven to 375¬∞F (180¬∞C). Pull off tin foil pieces. Layer 2 pieces to create square sheets. 2-3 tenders can go into 1 packet. So prepare the respective amount of sheets.
2. Mix black beans, corn and taco seasoning in a bowl. Divide between the foil sheets, making a small heap in the middle of each sheet.
3. Season the chicken tenders with salt and pepper and put them on top of the bean-corn mix on each sheet. 2-3 placed next to each other on each sheet.
4. Top chicken tenders with salsa and sprinkle shredded Mexican blend cheese over everything.
5. Bring first the sides of the foil together that have the opening from layering and fold the edges down. Then fold the other 2 sides in, so that the packet is securely closed.
6. Put packets on rack and put into the oven at a medium position. Bake for about 25 minutes until chicken tenders are fully cooked. Cut avocado in slices, if desired.
7. Open foil so that all of the food is exposed and set oven to broil high. Broil for another 2-3 minutes. Serve with avocado and sour cream, if desired.

Low fat/low carb recipes for cancer patient and family?,"Hug your family while you have them...
So my good friends wife had thyroid cancer which spread to her spine/bones. Not a good prognosis to say the least.

She was the cook for the family and my friend and his kids have been eating fast food for the past month as they don't cook nor even know where to begin shopping for food. The friend has been staying at the hospital and the kids fending for themselves at home.

His wife is on a low fat only diet and has lost 20lbs in the past 2 weeks so I doubt she would eat any of it but I would like to consider her. His son is a health nut and really doesn't do carbs.

I absolutely love to cook and own an instant pot and sous vide. I want to cook them some meals to take the strain off them while going through such an unpredictable time.

Any reccomendations other than vegan/vegetarian meals?

Thanks for any suggestions

Her back story if anyone cares: 
A month ago she tripped while playing with her dog and hurt her knee. She saw the doc for her knee injury and the doc noticed a cough she had. Her daughter had laryngitis at the time so she wanted to brush it off as sickness. The doc insisted on doing various tests and eventually did a biopsy that found extremely aggressive thyroid cancer. She had surgery that was successful in removing all of the infected thyroid. 2 weeks later they did a scan and found that it had rapidly spread to her spine and hip bones. She is starting chemo this week.
Not that anyone wants to hear a sob story here but it just shows that even if something small is going on, get your family members checked.

Finally found a Chinese dim sum dipping sauce,"I lived in Philly and often went to Chinatown for dim sum. I loved the dipping sauce served over the Cheung Fun. I hunted for that particular sauce recipe for over 10 years. I made every Chinese sauce recipe I could find, and the recipe remained a mystery to me. Then one day I tried yet another Chinese dipping sauce... and THERE IT WAS! I finally found it. I like to use this sauce when I make pot stickers. I have noticed it changes flavor overnight in the refrigerator. Making a big batch is not a good idea. It's fairly easy to make, though it is more involved than the making of other Chinese dipping sauces. I'm happy to prepare a batch each time I want some. Here's the recipe for this very special and quite unique flavored dipping sauce. If you've eaten dim sum in Philadelphia's Chinatown, you'll agree... this is the sauce.

people who bake desserts...,"how do you make your desserts as least likely to make you gain weight as possible? i made an apple pie using like 3 tablespoons of sugar (it asked for 3 cups), and the crust was made with flour, butter, and a tiny bit of water. i know butter has good fats in it, and sugar is what i need to avoid most, but since i need to be strict with my diet, but can't go without sweet things, AND i love baking, what's the best way to still keep them in my diet?

the first theory i have, which is what i tested with the apple pie, is to rely on the fruit's natural sweetness. i used honey crisp apples, my favorite. i could easily stuff some berries into a pie crust pocket, but is there a way to make even lower calorie crust? maybe just flour and water?",2019-11-11

What is your trick to peeling hard boiled eggs?,"  Well, not really that hard.  I simmer them for 6 minutes so the yolk is still moist and then put them directly into an ice bath.  But peeling them can be a nightmare.  Sometimes the shell and membrane peel right off with minimal effort.  Other times large chunks of egg white come off with the shell and sections of invisible membrane stay stuck to the egg.  I've tried a few tricks: poking a hole in the raw egg with a thumbtack, adding a little vinegar to the water and using eggs that are not too fresh.  I still get very inconsistent results even within the same package and sometimes the same batch.  

  I don't remember having this issue as a kid, maybe because my mom boiled eggs for 10 minutes or more until the yolks were gray and chalky.  Has anyone found a sure fire method to peel hard boiled eggs easily?",2019-11-11

"My partner is going to have her gallbladder removed in a couple of days, what are some meals I can make for her?","So I know that she's not supposed to have heavily fatty foods for a while (I'm soooo not prepared for this, I love cooking without limitations!) I guess my first question would have to be: What should she eat immediately after the surgery and what type of foods can I stock up on for her? 

My second question is: What are some low fat recipes (on a budget) that I can make for her in the months to come? I cook primarily Asian and Hispanic cuisine (I'm Chinese from South Florida!). Are there any changes I should make to those types of foods? I know both types of cuisine like to make use of their fats and oils. Also, are there other types of cuisine that are pretty low fat? I still want things to be tasty and not too bland for her - and I suppose myself as well since we are on a tight budget and we can't really afford to get separate stuff for each of us.

Are there things I can substitute in place of certain ingredients? Are different types of oils equally fatty or are there some that are ""better"" than others? Would non-fat ingredients be just as good as their counterparts or would that just depend on the recipe?

Last of all, do you guys have any recommendations or recipes that are delicious and low fat? I'd love to make a little recipe book and just compile everything I find. Thank you so much for reading this post! I really appreciate it :)",2019-11-14

How to prepare 2.5 lb Sirloin Tip Roast," 

I  have a 2.5 lb sirloin tip roast that I don't know what to do with.  My  family didn't do roasts growing up, so I don't have any history to draw  from.  I have 4 kids who like a good grilled steak, but get picky the  more ingredients I use (that they can see)... simple is better.

For  cooking methods, I have an Instant Pot, slow cooker, grill, oven,  cast-iron skillet, or frying pan.  I have a friend that has an  Alto-Shaam, which I understand is some restaurant-grade slow cooker, but  it seems like it might be overkill for me to use that, plus it's not  portable so I'd have to cook at their house.

Cheesecake recipe help!,"Recipe says, 'Bake the cheesecake for about an hour and a half. Turn off the oven and cool the cheesecake for at least one hour, then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least two hours.'




Does this mean I leave it in the oven to cool for an hour?


Since there seems to be some debate, here's the recipe. https://soyummy.com/recipe/circus-animal-cheesecake/




Key points here: no water bath, 32oz cream cheese, I will be topping the cake .



2nd edit. 


http://imgur.com/gallery/m5eCUd7


So I left the cheesecake in the oven, but I turned the oven off AND cracked it open. I kind of split the difference here? After about 45 minutes, I placed the cheesecake onto the stove and about 30 minutes later, I put it in the fridge. I think I should have absolutely have a water-bath. 

During baking, the cheesecake leaked water, it literally was dripping out of the spring form pan. The top cracked, kinda of deflated, and overall it was kind of dry. I realized that I didn't have any of the chocolate so I couldn't do a topping like planned. People still ate it, and comment red on how pretty it was.The main star of the night was my chili. I'm okay with that.",2019-11-16

Kabocha squash soup that I threw together yesterday. Amounts are missing or guesstimated so should have some previous cooking experience. Great if you have a leftover ham bone.,"**Ingredients**

Pot of of homemade chicken stock, 8 cups about

Sauteed, onions, celery, leeks, garlic

One smoked pork hock or preferably a ham bone

1/2 of a large roasted kabocha squash - lots of brown sugar flavors

1/2 to 1 Idaho potato peeled

nutmeg, allspice, paprika, salt, black pepper

tblspn fish sauce

**Recipe**

Dump sauteed vegetables into chicken stock with potato and ham bone/pork hock and boil until meat releases flavor.  You could add back the meat from the pork hock to the soup but there wasn't a lot so I just had that as a snack for myself.  If I had used a ham bone I might consider adding cubed ham as a garnish when plating.  Could add a swirl of cream at the table for taste and presentation but I would do one or the other as a personal preference.

Remove bone and add the squash.  Kabocha skin is edible so dump the whole thing in and use a stick blender to blend smoothly.  If using a stand blender be careful and preferably wait til cooled.

Add spices to taste.  Ham or pork hock is salted so take it easy with the additional salt.  Add fish sauce and reheat until fishy taste is gone.  

Serve immediately but of course more melded flavor next day.

Beautiful butternut color, brown sugar sweet but savory and the skin adds bits of green flecks which gives it visual appeal.",2019-11-17

Recipe for fried dough balls with raisins my German-American grandmother called futchens,"History is a little vague but I believe my grandmother's parents immigrated from Germany to the U.S. and she was born here. She used to make what she called ""futchens"" in the mornings when we went to visit. They were about the size of a ping-pong ball, deep fried, had raisins in them and little nubs of dough sticking out. We would break them open and dip them in granular sugar and they were just the best thing. I can't find ""futchens"" on the internet but found this \[krapfen\]( [https://germangirlinamerica.com/rheinische-ol-krapfen-new-year/](https://germangirlinamerica.com/rheinische-ol-krapfen-new-year/)) recipe that is pretty close taste- and texture-wise. They're a little harder and denser than I remember but that could be my baking/frying technique. I'll post a picture in the comments. The picture is really close to what my grandmother made but I remember the interior being more yellow. Appreciate any ideas of a ""futchen"" recipe or where the word comes from. Thanks!",2019-11-17

Decorated Homemade Gingerbread Cookies,"&#x200B;

These things didn't last very long at the office or in my home, they're wonderful and I'm sure there are few people in this world that do not enjoy gingerbread cookies. Especially if they are decorated... :P

Anyway, here's the recipe and a guide video below that for anyone who'd like to make these at home.

# Recipe

**For the cookie**

1. 1 cup of butter
2. 1 cup of sugar
3. 1 egg
4. 1 cup of molasses
5. 2 tablespoons of white vinegar
6. 5 cups of flour
7. 1/2 teaspoon of salt
8. 1 and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
9. 2 teaspoons of ginger
10. 1 teaspoon of cinnamon
11. 1 teaspoon of cloves

**For the royal icing**

1. 10 tablespoons of meringue powder
2. 2 pounds of powdered sugar
3. 3/4 cup of water

# Instructions

She uses a kitchenaid and I know that's not always an option so a normal bowl and utensil do just fine as well.

* Mix up butter and sugar until it's a little fluffy (professional term there)
* Mix in the molasses after that's all set
* Add in the vinegar and mix again
* Once that's all mixed, add the egg. *Tip: remove the eggshell before putting the egg in your mixing bowl.*
* Set the batter off to the side once you've the egg incorporated.
* Mix your dry ingredients in a large bowl (flour, salt, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, baking soda) really well.
* Now we're ready to fully mix your batter and your dry ingredients
   * Once your dry mix and batter are mixed, you don't really want it to be too terribly sticky. You can add a little bit of flour, such as a teaspoon, a little bit at a time (fully mixing again after each addition) until the batter is just right where it doesn't stick to your fingers (the video explains this better)
* Place the dough nice and flat on some plastic wrap and fully wrap the dough. Place in the fridge for a few hours.
* Once that's chilled for a few hours, we're going to roll it out to start cutting out our cookies. It's a good idea to flour the surface you're going to be rolling this dough out on.
   * For softer cookies: about 1/2"" thick
   * For crunchier cookies: about 1/4"" thick
* Take your cookie cutter (hopefully in the shape of gingerbread man, but we won't judge) and start cutting out your cookies.
   * You can re-roll out your dough after you run out of cookie cutter room to squeeze out a few more cookies
* Place your cut cookies onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (they'll expand but not much)
* Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and once that's ready, put the cookies in there for about:
   * For the softer cookies: 12-13 minutes
   * For the crunchier cookies: 13-14 minutes

At this point the cookies are very good by themselves but you can also use the frosting ingredients above, mix all that up and decorate till your heart's content!

Hopefully you enjoy them! [Here's the walk through video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV4QI-l4sbs) to help guide you through it as well.",2019-11-19

Dad's Upside Down Leatloaf,"Dad's EZ Upside Down Meatloaf

A recipe and technique for a very decent meatloaf

Following, and augmenting, the Lipton Onion Soup Mix Super Meatloaf recipe on the back of the box:

Mix up the wet ingredients:
Put 3/4 cup water in a large glass measuring cup, add 2 eggs and beat them with a whisk.

Add 1/3 cup siracha ketchup, a splash of Worchestershire sauce, 2 4oz cans of mushroom pieces (drained), and the envelope of onion soup mix.  Mix thoroughly.  Allow to sit and rehydrate the onion for 15 min while oven pre-heats to 350F.

Combine wet ingredients with 2 lbs ground meat and breadcrumbs.

Spray a loaf pan with olive oil spray, press the meat into the loaf pan.

Cover a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with olive oil spray.

Place the loaf pan UPSIDE DOWN on the parchment and put it in the oven for 20 minutes.

After 20 minutes the loaf will have slid out of the pan and is now resting on the baking sheet. The loaf is fragile at this point.  Carefully remove the pan off of the loaf, carefully brush siracha ketchup atop the loaf and continue baking for 55 minutes or until done. 

The result will be a loaf that is consistently baked throughout with most of the grease drained out into the pan and not absorbed into the rehydrated onion mix.

A 9x5 loaf pan will yield 10 decent slices of meatloaf.

The key takeaway here is baking it upside down; try it on your own favorite meatloaf recipe!",2019-11-24

"Veggie sausage and lentil lasagne recipe (best ""authentic"" tasting veggie lasagne I've made - great for dinner with friends, or for a couple of dinners and lunches throughout the week!)","Serves: 8

Difficulty: Quite easy, just time consuming, but a nice way to spend part of an afternoon. Labour intensive at points, but much of the time is cooking down time

Time: 2.5 hours (well spent/worth it)

&#x200B;

**Ingredients**   

¬∑ Olive oil 2tbsp

¬∑ Lasagne sheets x1 pack

¬∑ Veggies sausages x12 (Linda McCartney if possible (UK))

¬∑ Red split lentils 200g

¬∑ Celery x2 sticks

¬∑ Carrots x2

¬∑ Onions x2

¬∑ Garlic x 4-6 cloves

¬∑ Tinned plum tomatoes x2 400g tins

¬∑ Tomato puree

¬∑ Red wine x1 glass (optional but great for depth of flavour)

¬∑ Veggie stock pots/cubes x2

¬∑ Bay leaves x2

¬∑ Sage 1tsp 

¬∑ Basil 2tsp

¬∑ Oregano 1tsp

¬∑ Balsamic/red wine vinegar 1tsp

¬∑ Sugar (to taste)

¬∑ Salt and pepper (to taste)

¬∑ Mozzarella balls x2

¬∑ Cheddar (or similar)

¬∑ Parmesan

¬∑ Feta (optional)

¬∑ Milk 1pt

¬∑ Plain flour 1oz

¬∑ Butter 1oz

¬∑ Mustard 1tsp (optional)

¬∑ Cherry tomatoes x 12 (optional)

  

**Method**

1. Cook the veggie sausages in the oven according to packet instructions, and then continue with preparing the sauce whilst these cook.

2. Finely chop the onion, celery, carrot, and garlic cloves (a food processor gives a fine chop for a bolognese, or just very finely diced). Heat some olive oil in a large saucepan, and add the chopped veggies. Add salt and pepper, and fry gently but with sizzle over a medium heat for about five minutes until softened but not coloured.

3. Add 1/3 tube of tomato puree and cook over a medium/low heat for a further 5 minutes to cook out the acidic tang from the puree.

4. Turn up the heat and add the red wine (if using) and cook fast until the liquid has gone.

5. Add the tinned tomatoes, stock pots/cubes, vinegar, bay leaves, sage, basil, and oregano. Add about 400ml water (fill one of the empty tomato tins). Bring to a fast simmer. 

6. Once simmering, add the lentils (pre-wash these in a sieve under cold water). The lentils will cook in the sauce. Bring down to a medium-slow simmer.

7. After everything has settled down for a couple of minutes, taste and balance the flavour. Use salt, pepper, sugar, and any other veggie depth-giving things you have at hand to add flavour and balance (marmite, liquid aminos, parmesan rind, ketchup, cocoa powder, smoked paprika, etc.). Add any/all of these things in small amounts and taste regularly until you get it right. Remember, the sauce will get sweeter/deeper as it cooks in any case, so don‚Äôt go overboard at this point, and don‚Äôt worry if it doesn‚Äôt taste perfect at this stage, it is going to cook down for ages and develop its flavour throughout, and there is plenty of opportunity to modify it during the cooking process. You can be tasting and adjusting all throughout. Normally it is good to do a bit of balancing each time you check on and stir the sauce whilst it is cooking down. 

8. Cook for about 60-90 minutes, checking on the sauce regularly (every 10-15mins). At first it will be *very* watery, but this is fine as the lentils will absorb some of this as they cook, and it will cook down. The lentils will take a long time to cook in the sauce, so for the first half of the cooking they will be crunchy when you taste it, but this is fine, and you still want them to have a little bit of bite to them when done. 

9. At some point during the sauce cooking process, the veggie sausages in the oven will be cooked. Take them out of the oven to cool, and then chop roughly into small chunks (suggest half-moons). Leave the oven on at gas 4-5 (180C) to keep it hot for the cooking of the lasagne. 

10. Prepare the b√©chamel white sauce whilst the tomato sauce is cooking. Grate a big pile of cheddar cheese beforehand. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat, add the flour to the melted butter to combine into a paste, and cook for a minute or so. Slowly start adding the milk, a glug at a time, stirring constantly. Once all the milk is combined, bring to a simmer, and cook for two minutes to thicken. Add in the grated cheddar, and a teaspoon of mustard (if using). Stir to combine and taste. Season and/or add more cheese if you think necessary. Set aside until needed. 

11. Once you are happy that the sauce and the lentils in it are almost ready after about 60-90 minutes, combine the veggie sausages into the sauce. The sausages will absorb some of the remaining moisture, and might make it quite thick, so add more water to get the desired final consistency (you want a lasagne sauce to be well cooked down, but not too dry. It should hold its shape when you dig up a wooden spoonful from the pan, but still ooze and have good sauciness to it). Give it a few minutes on a low heat to allow the sausages and sauce to cook together. Taste the sauce again, it should be really rich and balanced by this point. Do more balancing if necessary. 

12. Chop the mozzarella balls into slices and crumble/roughly chop about 100-150g of feta. Grate a bit more cheddar and some parmesan. Halve the cherry tomatoes (if using).

13. Build the lasagne. Rub olive oil around a large ceramic oven dish. Start with a bottom layer of lasagne sheets, spread in a single layer. Add your first layer of tomato sauce, aiming for about a ¬æ-1 inch thick layer. Add half of the b√©chamel sauce as a layer on top of this and spread evenly with a spatula to cover the tomato sauce. Add a layer of lasagne sheets. Sprinkle in the crumbled feta on top of this layer of lasagne sheets. Cover with tomato sauce another ¬æ-1 inch thick (if at this point you have more tomato sauce left over, avoid the temptation to try and stuff it all in, as it will be too much. Save it separately in the fridge/freeze it down to have as bolognese sauce with another meal). Top the tomato sauce with the sliced mozzarella spread out evenly. Cover with another layer or lasagne sheets. Add the second half of the b√©chamel on top of this and spread evenly. Add the grated cheddar and parmesan spread out across the top of the lasagne. Stud the top with chopped cherry tomatoes (if using). If you like you can add some pepper and dried basil on top too. 

14. Put in the oven at gas 4-5 (180C) for 35-40 minutes. Once cooked leave on the side to cool and settle for a good 5-10 minutes before serving. This will help with the serving and also make it hold its shape better.

15. Enjoy with a nice salad or some garlic bread!",2019-11-25

how do i cook a small ham?,"hello all!! i apologize in advance for any formatting issues, i‚Äôm on mobile.

this is my and my husband‚Äôs first year of thanksgiving away from our family. we moved across the country a few months ago and aren‚Äôt able to visit over thanksgiving for a few reasons (i‚Äôll spare y‚Äôall the life story lol.) i‚Äôm just cooking for the two of us this year, and i‚Äôm really excited to try my hand at thanksgiving. in the past i usually just brought a store-bought side dish to the family dinner, but i‚Äôve recently gotten really into cooking and baking and would like the challenge. this also means that when it comes to cooking this ham, i have absolutely no idea what i‚Äôm doing. 

we both agreed that we would want ham instead of turkey, so i bought a small ham. only problem is, i have no idea how to cook it. there are lots of terms that i have no clue as to the meaning, and i‚Äôll always think i found a good recipe, and then it mentions a technique or specific piece of cooking equipment that i don‚Äôt know how to utilize and it starts all over.

i have found a recipe for the glaze that i think we would enjoy, it‚Äôs for a large ham so i‚Äôm going to half it so we have less food waste. 

‚ÄúIngredients:
‚Ä¢ 1 cup packed brown sugar
‚Ä¢ 1/2 cup orange juice 
‚Ä¢ 1/2 cup honey 
‚Ä¢ 1 teaspoon cinnamon
‚Ä¢ 1/2 teaspoon cloves‚Äù 
(link will be in the comments)

the ham is half of a small ham, only 4.39 pounds. i read online that ham needs 15-20 minutes to cook at 350 degrees, so mine would be a bit over an hour to cook. the source also said it needs to be 145 degrees when it‚Äôs fully done. i bought a food thermometer and all that jazz, so i‚Äôm good in that respect.

i have 2 of those big aluminum disposable trays, as well as a glass baking pan. the baking pan had instructions to pour about an inch-inch and a half of water or another liquid in the bottom of the pan when making a ham or turkey. i don‚Äôt believe the aluminum pans have this rule, but i could be mistaken.

i have no idea if halving the glaze would still be okay, or how to cook the ham. would the glaze only work with a certain cooking method, or would it be okay regardless? if it‚Äôs in the glass pan with the water, would i wrap it in foil to keep the water from touching it, or would it be okay if the water touched it? i don‚Äôt have anything specialized, i just have the aluminum and glass pans. will i need to buy another item to cook it with? i‚Äôm hesitant to stick with a certain recipe and just look into the equipment involved, because i don‚Äôt know if there is something about my ham specifically that would throw the recipe off. 

we live in an apartment and have a very old oven. if it was a matter of slapping it on a pan and putting it in the oven it would be fine, but all this talk of broilers and roasting trays and all that is really confusing to me. this is my first time cooking a large piece of meat in general! if there is a specific piece of equipment i need to buy in order to make this ham i would be fine getting it, i just have no idea what i need.

2. I have one remaining 8"" round of chocolate cake. I can't stand how over kill it is for sugar.  The cake by itself isn't terrible. But frosting makes it inedible.  


I'm not a terrible Baker, I just got lazy. It was my own birthday and I didn't feel like putting in a ton of effort. I just wanted cake. Quickly. (see mistake #1&2).

### Ingredients

* 1 lb fresh cod fillet, skin removed (or other fish like halibut or salmon)
* 2 1/4 cups whole milk
* 1 bay leaf
* salt and black pepper
* 6 Tbsp butter, divided
* 2 parsnips, peeled and chopped
* 2 leeks, peeled, washed, and sliced
* 3 Tbsp all purpose flour
* 2/3 cup frozen peas (don't defrost)
* 3-4 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
* 1  cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 2 tsp prepared horseradish, or horseradish cream

### Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 350F
* Put  the milk and bayleaf in a saucepan over medium heat. Cut the fish into 4  or 5 pieces and add to the milk along with 1/2 tsp salt. Bring to a  gentle boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for a few minutes.  Remove from the heat, cover, and set aside.
* In  a large pot melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and saute the parsnips and  leeks for about 10 minutes over medium heat until softened. Stir often  and don't allow them to burn.
* Strain the fish and reserve the milk. Set both aside.
* Add  the flour to the parsnips and leeks and cook, stirring, for a few  minutes, and again, don't let it brown. Slowly pour in the strained  milk, stirring constantly, until smooth. Continue heating until the  mixture thickens and almost comes to a simmer.
* Add  the fish to the pot, breaking it into large chunks as you add it.  Season with salt and plenty of fresh cracked black pepper to taste. Stir  in the frozen peas. Cover and set aside on the stove top to keep warm.
* Meanwhile  cook the potatoes in plenty of salted water until completely soft.  Drain them and whip with 2 tablespoons of the butter, the cheese, the  butttermilk, and the horseradish. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Be sure to get out all lumps.
* Turn  the fish mixture into your baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes.  You can pipe them on (see inspructions in the blog post) or just spoon  them on. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and gently dab over  the mashed potatoes with a silicone brush. If you like you can brush  again during cooking.
* Bake for 30-40 minutes until golden browned and bubbling.",2019-11-30
Pineapple Honey Steak Marinade,"Thanks to the anime Food Wars I made my best steak ever. The main characters dish is ruined by a classmate bully who poured salt all over his beef bourguignon. The protagonist partner believes they don't have enough time to cook another pot before the deadline. They manage to do it because the main character uses honey in the marinade. Honey has properties that break down the proteins in meat so you can cook it faster. He also mentions that pineapple juice can do the same thing. So I set out to make a marinade that included both of them and I made a delicious steak that I could pull apart with my fork.

**Ingredients**

1/2 cup honey

1/3 cup pineapple juice

1/2 cup soy sauce

1 tbsp ginger

1 tsp cumin

1 tsp garlic

2 tsp sea salt

1 tsp black pepper

1/8th cup diced onion

2 8oz filet mignon steaks

**Directons**

1.Combine all ingredients (except for the steaks) in a bowl and whisk together until it is a homogenized liquid

2. Put the steaks in a 1 gallon zip lock bag and pour the marinade over the steaks

3.Remove all air from the bag by closing it all the way and then making a small opening for a straw

4.Insert the straw and suck out all the air then remove the straw and reseal the bag

5.Place the steak in the fridge for 8 hours

6.Flip and massage the steak every hour

8.Grill the steak with your preferred method or follow mine in the next steps

7.Turn your grill on high and wait for it to get up to 450 degrees

8.Place the steak on the grill close the grill and wait 10 seconds

9.Open the grill and flip the steak, wait 10 seconds.

10.Turn the grill to low heat and open the grill as needed until the grill temperature is down to 350 degrees

11.Grill for 15 minutes and flip the steak

12.Grill for 10 minutes at this point the steak should be medium rare

13.From here on out check the steak temperature every 10 minutes until it reaches your desired cooked temperature

14.Remove from the grill and enjoy",2019-11-30

Recipe/Cookbook app for iPad?,"Looking for recommendations on a good iPad app that lets users enter their own recipes to be store digitally, import recipes from websites, add photos, and has a nice UI. 

I have a lot of handwritten family and personal recipes that I‚Äôd like to scan in. Some apps say you can scan a photo of a hand written recipe for it to transcribe it to text (scan to text) and other seem to just allow you to scan an upload of handwritten recipes. Both of those features would be fine, however, the scan to text might be interesting. 

I‚Äôve browsed a few and thinking about picking on of the following (curious if anyone here uses any of these):

Chicken and Dumplings,"My best friend‚Äôs mom taught me how to make this recipe and I have made it the same way every time until yesterday. The only difference was that I pulled the chicken off the bone and put it back. Duh. Don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think of that one before. 

Ingredients 

4 chicken thighs, bone in 

1 Tablespoon Bell‚Äôs seasoning (or ground thyme)

1 teaspoon cracked black pepper

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon paprika or a Cajun spice rub (I used Central BBQ dry rub) or smoked paprika (or get creative here) 

Olive oil

2 quarts Kitchen Basics chicken stock 

4 cups chopped onion

2 cups chopped celery

2 cups chopped onion 

Bisquick 

Buttermilk 

1. Pat chicken very dry. Mix spices together and then dry rub chicken with spices. 

2. Heat some oil in a medium stockpot and saut√© chicken, skin side down first, for four minutes a side. Don‚Äôt crowd the chicken, do it in batches if you need to. 

3. Cover the chicken with stock and bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer. 

4. Add vegetables and pop a loose lid over top. Let simmer 10 - 15 minutes while you make the dumplings. 

5. Mix bisquick and buttermilk to a very thick batter consistency or follow bisquick‚Äôs dumplings recipe (which uses regular milk, which is fine).

6.  Canele dumplings into simmering soup carefully, until the entire top of the soup is covered with dumpling batter. Place a lid loosely over top and allow dumplings to steam for 10 minutes or until done. (No sticky dough). 

7. Turn off the heat and let cool a bit. 20 minutes. This will help the dumplings stay together. Then scoop out the dumplings and place in a bowl. Pull out the chicken and place in a separate bowl. Let cool 20 minutes or until cool enough to handle. 

8. Pull chicken skin off, discard. Then pull chicken meat off the bone entirely, and roughly shred. You will want some chunks. Stir chicken back into soup and salt to taste. Gently fold in dumplings and reheat the whole thing to serving temperature. Serve more than warm but less than simmering.",2019-12-04

Puerto Rican Hot Chocolate,"Hey guys so when I was younger and it was the cold months my grandma would prepare hot chocolate for me and my little sister. We are Puerto Rican so she would make Hot Chocolate differently from what most people are used to. 

For the chocolate she would boil a couple cups of milk and drop in an equal amount of tabs of Chocolate Cortes and stir that into the milk on a low flame. 

While thats working its magic she would cut up cubes of Queso Estilo Holandes or Holland style cheese. it is a sharp cheese thats wrapped in a red wax. so she would cut that up into tiny cubes and drop a few cubes into our cups.

When the chocolate has fully combined with the milk and boiled on low for a few minutes she would pour it into our cups over the cubbed Holland cheese. She would let it sit for a minute to make sure the cheese melts a bit and she would then serve it to us. 

So at the end of a nice sweet and salty cup of hot chocolate is a nice reward of sweet chocolaty cheese!",2019-12-05

Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting,"* 12 ounces milk, any percentage will do (about 1 1/2 cups; 340g)
* 8 ounces sugar (about 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons; 225g)
* 1 1/2 ounces cornstarch (about 1/3 cup)
* 3 large eggs, room temperature
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract (15g)
* 16 ounces full-fat Philadelphia cream cheese, softened
* 1 stick unsalted butter, softened (8 tbsp, 1/2 cup)
* ¬æ lb powdered sugar (more or less, depends how stiff you need the frosting to be)
* Pinch of salt (about ¬º tsp)
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract (15g)
* Juice of half a lemon

For the custard:
1. whisk sugar and cornstarch together in a medium bowl, followed by the eggs.
2. Heat milk to a simmer. Pour the warmed milk, ¬Ω cup at a time, over the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Pour the lumpy mixture into a pot and heat for 5 mins till it bubbles sluggishly. The mixture cannot go over 180 F. Stir constantly, it should be smooth by the end of 5 mins.
3. Stir in vanilla extract. Put custard into a holding bowl and place in the fridge, it should be good for up to one week. You can sieve it through a fine mesh to make it smoother.

For the frosting
1. Place cream cheese and butter in bowl and beat on medium speed until smooth and fluffy, at least 5 mins. Add vanilla and lemon juice to taste and scrape the sides of the bowl.
2. Gradually add the sugar and salt to the butter mixture on low speed till well blended and smooth. Add room temperature custard one large spoonful at a time to get the consistency you desire, I usually use 75% to 100% of the batch, depending on what decorations I'm going to pipe. Frosting should be thick enough to hang upside down from a spoon. Drizzle in juice of a lemon, up to half a lemon, and/or add lemon zest to make the icing more tangy.",2019-12-06

Savory Mexican Lentil Soup,"[Mexican Lentil Soup ](https://imgur.com/a/09fwu8T)


You‚Äôll need:

- 1.5 cups of regular lentils 
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped 
- 6 cloves of garlic, chopped 
- 4 tomatoes, chopped 
- 2 leveled tbs of chicken bouillon (we use Better than Bouillon)
- 2 dried chiles guajillo 
- 3 dried chiles puya 
- 1/2 tsp of ground cumin 
- 1/4 tsp of ground all spice 

Prep: 

- Boil 2 liters of water and add lentils once water is boiling. Cover and turn down to mid-low  and cook for 20-25 mins, or until tender. DO NOT ADD SALT. 

- Boil the dried chiles for 5 mins, cover and let it sit for 10 mins until the fresh is soft. Once the flesh is no longer tough, rinse under cold water and remove the stems, seeds, and veins. 

While the lentils are boiling, add the chopped onion to another pan and cook with a tbs of your preferred oil. Cook for 5 mins with a sprinkle of salt. Add the chopped garlic and tomatoes. Cook on medium for 15 mins, stirring frequently.  Add about 1/4 of water into the pan, turn the heat to high and add the chicken bouillon, all spice, and cumin. Cook the dried spices into the mix for another 5 mins. 

Add the cleaned and hydrated peppers into a blender, along with a cup of water. Blend the hydrated peppers with water for 2 mins. In that same blender, add the tomato and onion mixture you were cooking into the blender and blend for 1 min on high. Clean the pan you used to cook the onions and tomatoes and add 1 tbs of oil and heat on high. Only get it hot for 25-30‚Äôseconds so oil doesn‚Äôt burn. 

Be careful here, but add the mixture from the blender onto the pan with hot oil. It‚Äôs important that you stir the mixture immediately because a little will jump outside the pan. Cook the mixture for 5 mins. My mom says this is traditionally done in Mexico to any ‚Äúguisados‚Äù to make sure the sauce is flavorful. My mom calls this a mole, which in Mexico is a term used for any thick flavorful sauce or mixture. 

Once the *mole* is done, dump out about 2/3 of the water from the cooked lentils and add the mole. Cook the lentils with the mixture for 15-20 mins on low after a boil is reached. At this point, add salt to taste if the chicken bouillon you used is insufficient. 


Optional: adding cooked bacon. 

My sister adds finely chopped celery, carrots, and potatoes and fresh peas during the last 15 mins of cooking, also super good! 


Hope you all enjoy, thanks!",2019-12-06

Then about a teaspoon of each; vanilla extract, baking powder and baking soda. Mix the sugar and coconut oil with a mixer, then add the eggs and vanilla extract and mix more. In a seperate bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, and baking powder (most recipes will say to do this first, but I don't think it matters). Then, gradually mix the flour into the sugar mixture.

Chili Hoisin Noodle Stir-fry,"https://preview.redd.it/ajxzz9scio341.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=b327ec0d57f1bacecb685ab96aaa68c8696e4af6

I made some good noodles earlier and don't feel like making a whole blog post, so I'll be throwing the recipe up on here. It's not too difficult to make, but take care to not get distracted, as it's very easy to mess up if you do.

**Ingredients**

* 6 oz. thin egg noodles, cooked al dente and cooled to room temperature
* 1 1/2 C shredded cabbage
* 3/4 C broccoli stems or heads, cut into strips
* 1 green bell pepper, cut into strips
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced or cut into strips
* 1/4 C cooking oil, such as canola or peanut
* 3 tbsp hoisin sauce
* 2 tbsp chili paste or 2 crushed Thai chilis
* 1 tbsp fish sauce
* 1 tbsp soy sauce

**Directions**

1. Fill wok with 1/4C water, cabbage, and broccoli and put on high heat. Cover with a lid. Once the water begins to boil, steam for 5 minutes, adding more water if needed. Add the bell pepper and steam for another 3 minutes. Remove the lid and let the remaining water evaporate, then set the steamed vegetables aside.
2. Heat oil in wok over high heat and add the onion. Fry, stirring occasionally, until the onion just barely begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Add the steamed vegetables and continue frying, stirring more often, for another 3 minutes.
3. Add in the noodles and begin stirring constantly (the noodles are prone to sticking and burning if you don't). Fry for 2 more minutes, then add in the hoisin sauce, chili paste, fish sauce, and soy sauce. Toss to coat well and fry for another minute before removing from heat and stirring.

**Notes:** Using cooled noodles helps prevent them from clumping in the wok (much like how cold rice is used in making fried rice). To prevent them from clumping as they cool, toss them with a bit of rice vinegar (or oil if you don't care about fat content). You can make this recipe in a skillet - just make sure to lower the temperature to medium instead of high.

Does anyone know the recipe from an old beloved restaurant?",2019-12-10
Finally did it!,"Background:  my grandmother (who passed away a couple years ago) used to make bone  broth soup. She'd always ask us to save her the bones whenever we had a  large meat (turkey, chicken, ham, etc.) and she'd make and can some bone  broth so she always had some available for soup. (Makes for a great,  hearty soup.) Now, when she passed one of the things I got was her  recipe book and, desperate to keep the tradition alive, I flipped  through it to see what the recipe for bone broth soup is. Unfortunately,  the book had been submerged under water at some point, the ink ran, and  the recipe was illegible.

So I  did what anyone in my generation did: I went to the internet. On Maria's  Farm Country Kitchen I found a recipe for turkey bone soup, made  it--and it's the same thing. The *exact*  same thing. I have now duly logged this recipe into my own handwritten  cookbook so it (hopefully) won't get lost again. But I'm so happy I  finally did it, and I wanted to share!

Now, for those who can't find the recipe, here's what you do.

1. Get a large stock pot.
2. Put turkey bones in stock pot (try to get as much meat off of them as possible)
3. Add water to cover turkey bones. Add salt to water (I used two and a half tablespoons, but whatever you prefer)
4. Bring water to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer.
5. Skim the oil, fat, and skin off the top of the pot. (There will be tiny bubbles. Get them too.)
6. When  bones start to get soft, scrape soft part away to expose more bone to  the water (make sure soft part you scraped goes back into the water),  set back into the water, skim if necessary.
7. Repeat as necessary until bones have collapsed in structure and broth is a pearly white-yellow.
8. Drain broth through strainer into either large bowl or large pot. Throw bones.
9. Drain broth through strainer back into original pot. Throw anything that wasn't caught the first time.
10. Make  soup (adding other spices waits for this step), can leftover broth for  soup later consumption. (I, personally, use self-sealing canning jars.)

And it's good! Side note--do **not** keep longer than six months.",2019-12-10

### [https://mypureplants.com/vegan-custard-tart](https://mypureplants.com/vegan-custard-tart)

### Ingredients

* 2 cup Dairy-free milk (cashew or soy) or shaken canned full-fat coconut milk for an even creamier custard
* 1/2 cup Maple syrup
* 3 Tbsp Corn starch
* 1/4 tsp Turmeric
* 1 tsp Vanilla extract
* 1 9-inch Pie Crust (homemade or store-bought)

### Instructions

* First, take a small bowl and mix corn starch and 1/4 cup of milk. Stir until combined. *(I do this to make sure there are no lumps and the corn starch is properly dissolved.)*
* Take a saucepan. Add the remaining milk, the maple syrup, the dissolved corn starch and¬†cook on medium heat until it starts to thicken. 
* When it is thick enough, add vanilla extract. 
* Finally, add the turmeric (optional) to get the yellowish color you would get if you add eggs. I would add first 1/4 tsp and see if you need the other 1/4 tsp.
* Take a pre-baked tart or pie crust. 
* Pour the vegan custard in the tart crust, while the custard is still hot. As the vegan custard is already ready, you don't need to bake it after filling. Just chill it in the fridge until it is set. You can serve and slice it only after that.¬†",2019-12-10

Salisbury Steak Recipe NEEDED,"My husband has requested something called Salisbury Steak that his mom used to make. If his mom was still alive, I would ask her for the recipe.

Also, it appears the ""steaks"" aren't steaks at all, but are more like fried meatloaf patties.

My husband rarely makes food requests, so I'd really like to do this for him. Any recipes that don't include mushrooms would be greatly appreciated.

Focaccia recipe help,"Hi everyone, I've been trying out my dad's focaccia bread recipe with pretty good success but I think the recipe could use a little help. For starters I think it needs to be converted to grams and I don't like the idea of adding the dry active yeast at the same time as the salt. I think an autolyse might be needed but I don't know how that would effect proofing time. I was hoping you could take a look and recommend some updates?

Ingredients 3 1/2 cups flour 2 1/2 tsp salt 2 1/2 tsp instant yeast 1/2 cup olive oil 2 1/4 cup water

Herb oil: 1 cup olive oil 1/2 - 1/3 chopped herbs 1 clove garlic halved 1 tsp salt 1 tsp pepper Pinch of chili flakes

Mix yeast, salt, oil, water in bowl.

Add flour cup by cup until a sticky dough is achieved.

Transfer dough to flour dusted counter. Dust dough liberally with flour. Pat dough into rectangle and let rest 5 minutes.

Coat hands with flour. Stretch dough from end to end until twice its size. Fold into thirds letter style until back to its original rectange shape. Loosely cover with plastic and let rest 30 minutes. 

Repeat the stretch and fold 2 more times allowing dough to rest 30 minutes between. After the last fold let rest one hour.

Make Herb oil. Warm all ingredients over low heat for 5 minutes. Remove garlic and let cool completely.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Drizzle with two tbsp Herb oil. Transfer dough to pan using oiled hands and bench scraper. Spread 1/4 cup oil over dough.

Use finger tips to dimple dough. And spread to edges of pan. Avoid tearing or ripping the dough. If too springy let rest 10 minutes. Fill pan keeping uniform thickness.

Cover with plastic and refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days.

Remove from fridge 3 hours before baking. Drizzle with 2 tbsp oil and dimple again. Cover with plastic and let rest 3 hours or until double in size.

Preheat to 500f. Place pan in middle rack of oven and reduce heat to 450f. 

Bake 10 minutes. Rotate pan and bake for another 10-15 minutes until lightly golden brown. 

Cool on drying rack.

It is so easy.... you will see.

**Broth:** Clean the Chicken and put the Chicken in cold water. 1 Onion, 3 Carrots in pieces, 3 gloves of Garlic, 5 Black Peppercorn, 1 Bay Leaf, Salt and 1 whole chili. Cook for one Hour until the flesh solves from the legs and Wings. 

Put the Chicken out of the Stock and let it rest for a while, then start pulling the flesh of and do not forget to give your cat a share.

Collect anything out of your broth. You will not need it anymore.

Cook eggs for 6 Minutes and rinse under cold water. 

Cook asia wheat Noodles and rinse under cold water.

Now you slice all the Vegetables you like into slices or pieces. You may use Carrots, Cabbage, Brussels Sprouts, Green Beans, Pakchoi etc. . 

Let the broth cook again and put the vegetables one after the other into the broth - first the veggies that cook longer and after a few minutes the rest. 2 Minute before the Veggies are Ready add the Chicken-Flesh. Salt, Pepper to your taste.

Serving: Put some Noodles in your Bowl, ad two half eggs - now add the chicken Soup.

Topping with raw Soybeansprouts, scallions, Roasted Sesame Seeds, a bit chilli-oil and sesame oil.

A special occasion calls for a special dessert. Taaa-daaa! üéÖüèº Chocolate Christmas Yule Log (B√ªche de No√´l) üéÑüç∞,"&#x200B;

[B√ªche de No√´l](https://reddit.com/link/edn47m/video/s37atihnwx541/player)

[**Full video tutorial here**](https://youtu.be/BLhhSCUpSno)

**INGREDIENTS**

Chocolate Sponge Cake

* Oil 30g
* Melted Dark Chocolate 35g
* 4 Eggs
* Water 60g
* Cake Flour 85g
* Chocolate Powder 30g
* Sugar 60g

Chocolate Cream

* Cream 350g
* Icing Sugar 45g
* Chocolate Powder 8g
* Chocolate Paste 50g

Chocolate Paste

*  The ratio is 3:1 with dark chocolate and cream

Cherry Jelly

* Any cherry jelly packets from a supermarket would do J

Meringue Mushrooms

* 3 Egg Whites 
* Sugar 250g

Some powdered sugar, shaved chocolate and chocolate powder to make it snow‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

**STEPS**

***Chocolate sponge cake***

1. In a large bowl, mix oil and melted dark chocolate together until well combined
2. In another large bowl, separate 4 egg yolks and egg whites, the egg yolks go into the melted chocolate bowl
3. Mix the melted chocolate and egg yolks well
4. Slowly add in water, mix well
5. Whisk sifted cocoa powder and cake flour into the yolk batter
6. Whip egg whites (I used a KitchenAid) until frothy, gradually at sugar in, whip until medium shiny peaks form.
7. Fold egg yolk mixture into the meringue in two batches
8. Pour and spread the cake batter into a pan (31x22cm), tap to release air bubbles
9. Bake at 160C for 10 mins
10. Once cooked, set aside to cool down completely

***Chocolate Paste***

11. Mix melted dark chocolate with cream, the ration is 3:1.

I don‚Äôt have the exact measurement here, some people prefer stronger chocolate flavour, while some prefer less. If you don‚Äôt feel like making it, then using Nutella or any other chocolate spread is fine too üòâ

***Chocolate Cream***

12. Add cream, icing sugar, cocoa powder and chocolate paste into a mixing bowl

13. Stir until smooth

14. Beat at medium speed until soft peaks form

***Assemble***

15. When the cake is ready, slightly cut out 3 lines on the longest edge of the cake (DON‚ÄôT CUT THROUGH THE CAKE‚ùóÔ∏è)

16. Spread the cream over the top (at 03:35 of the video, I specified how I spread the cream)

17. Spread cherry jelly over the cream

18. Spread shaved chocolate over the jelly

19. At the slightly cut end, peel off the lining gently and then roll the cake up with paper

20. Put the cake into fridge for 10 mins to set the shape

21. Cut a piece of the log off (about 2-3 inches in length) and use a little chocolate ganache to attach it to the side of the cake to make it look like a little branch

22. Spread the chocolate cream over the cake

23. Use a cake tester or a fork to create bark lines in the cake, dust it with powdered sugar and cocoa powder

üéäüéäThat‚Äôs it! Now, unleash your creativity to decorate it! I picked some flowers from my tiny garden, some Aussie Christmas figurines and of course my homemade meringue mushrooms for everyone to nibble on! Oh! I think rosemary sprigs will look good too!! üéäüéä",2019-12-21

"Okay call me crazy but hear me out, hummus fish sauce stir fry.","Can someone else tell me if I'm going crazy or if my leftovers actually combined to make what was an insanely good stir fry. I'm a home-cook so pardon me if the measurements are fudgy I'd recommend doing the saucing to taste and in proportion to the amount of ingredients you are stir-frying this recipe was designed for 1 meal for me or two normal people. 
 


Ingredients:

Pork chop of your choosing, cut into 1/3 inch strips

Head of broccoli cut into florets and stem cuts

One potato cubed

Half an onion cut into strips

Clove of garlic minced

Pre-made hummus

Fish sauce

Soy sauce

Canola oil

Cilantro

Rice

Directions:

Cook rice

Steam the potatoes and broccoli (start with the potatoes and then about Midway through add the broccoli as it will cook faster) 

In a large skillet over high heat canola oil in the bottom to coat and then add the pork strips allowing them to sit and get color on them (don't stir immediately or they will stick, allow a crust to form) 

When the pork has good color add the onions stirring more frequently and salt

Once the onions are softened and have a little color add the clove of garlic

Once garlic is heated add a little bit of water to the bottom of the pan to pull up some of the fond. Stir until the majority of the stuff on the bottom of the pan is up then add the potatoes and broccoli and stir over high heat to combine. 

The final step is making the saucing, add about 1 part soy sauce and fish sauce to 2 parts hummus. Add the soy sauce in the fish sauce to the pan when hot and then kill the heat and stir in the hummus.

Add cilantro over top and serve next to Rice





So I know this sounds absolutely crazy and it was a pure move of me trying to use up leftovers in my fridge but the hummus actually adds a really nice acidic nutty flavor that matches really well with the pork soy and fish sauce. please someone try this and if you do try it p.m. me and let me know if it actually is good or if my taste buds are just stupid.",2019-12-22

Help with a recipe for Christmas. Orange nutmeg molasses glazed quail? Idk if it would even work.,"Forgive me if this isn't the right subreddit.

I'm a pretty good cook when it comes to following recipes, but I honestly don't have enough experience to come up with one of my own. For christmas I want to do something special for my sister and I. We are home alone, as our family has work and we cant afford to fly.

So we came up with an idea for a recipe. Orange and nutmeg glazed quail. Perfect portions for two. Very christmassy flavors. Also, the asian markets dont close for Christams so we can easily get quail.

So... based off of another fruit juice glazed quail recipe I've used, would you all think this is doable?

Glaze-

Carmelize 2 tbsp sugar in a small sauce pan 

Slowly add 2 cups orange juice 

Reduce to 1/4cup and add nutmeg and ginger

For the quail I would be soaking 4 of them in brine for about 1 hour, patting dry, browning on a pan, then glazing them with the orange nutmeg ginger [molasses?] glaze and transferring them to the oven for 4 mins, glazing again, and then cooking until done.

If anyone has any input, any way I can make this perfect, I would really appreciate it! Like can I even make an orange molasses? I've never worked with orange juice before so I'm sure I've gotten some core thing wrong. Help!",2019-12-24

"""Fool-Proof Chicken"": A casserole with a Canadian cold war context","This is a chicken + rice + wine recipe that my father first heard in the 1980s (?) on CBC Radio's ""Morningside"" with host Peter Gzowski.  It has been a special-occasion dish in our home ever since. (Story below recipe)

&nbsp;

**Fool-Proof Chicken**

&nbsp;



**Ingredients**

* 2 - 3 chicken breasts

* 1 can cream of celery soup

* 1 can cream of chicken soup

* 1 envelope (dry) onion soup mix

* 2 cups white wine

* 1 cup long grain rice, uncooked

* 1 cup each carrots and celery, sliced on diagonal

&nbsp;

**Directions**

1\.  Combine all ingredients except chicken.  Let stand several hours or overnight.

2\.  Place chicken on top of the rice mixture.  

3\.  Bake, covered, at 350¬∞F, for one hour.  Stir; Add more water/wine if required.  Total cooking time up to 90 minutes, depending on size of chicken pieces and softness of veggies.



&nbsp;

**Wrrdgrrl's Tweaks**

1\.  I like to use boneless, skinless, chicken thighs.  Use whatever you prefer.

2\.  I add a couple of pints of mushrooms, sliced *and pre-sauteed* (I tried cooking them with the rice, but their released moisture throws off the rice/wine ratio.)  Canned, drained mushrooms would work, but I prefer fresh.

3\.  It's especially nice, when reheating leftovers, to pan-fry in butter so the rice browns and gets all carmelized and delicious.

&nbsp;

********

&nbsp;


**Recipe Origin**

As mentioned above, it was CBC radio host Peter Gzowski who told the story about a (prairie?) household who had unexpected company.  The details are fuzzy but I'll do my best:  Probably during the 1959 North American tour, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and his wife arrived, unannounced, at the home of an ordinary Canadian couple.  The reason for this impromptu visit is unknown (Snowstorm?  Canceled flight?)  Anyhow, the wife happened to have these ingredients on hand and skillfully combined them into a delicious and impressive meal for the esteemed guests.    I would love it if anyone else knew about this story and can help clarify details.",2019-12-24

 ‚ÄúI used less molasses, doubled the spices, added applesauce and reduced the water, baked at a lower temp and it was delicious!! 5 stares thanks for the recipe!‚Äù   
At that rate. It‚Äôs a NEW RECIPE!! Write it down and get your own 5 stars (if it‚Äôs that good) just drives me crazy.   
Sorry. Rant over. I smell ginger and need to test my cake.   
Merry Christmas.",2019-12-25

Mom's incredible cheesecake,"Hi, everybody!  Alchemist here.  I am a long-time reddit user, and have just discovered this sub.  I'm a 32 year old man, and I love to cook, it is one of my favorite things to do.  Nothing is more gratifying than watching people enjoy something delicious I have made.  This is my first submission here, and I intend to make many more.  I love sharing recipes, which surprises people... I believe good food is for everyone, and there is no recipe I want to keep secret (except in situations where I am given a recipe with the explicit instructions to not share it).

I was a chef for many years, I love making dinners.  But I also love desserts, and today I will be sharing my go-to dessert recipe for when I want to impress, and to date, it has never failed to be a huge hit. This recipe was passed on to me from my mom, an amazing cook, who got it from her grandmother.  Before we get to the recipe, here are a few short points about it:

&#x200B;

\*The recipe is presented in its original form, but there are two tweaks I sometimes make, which are listed as well. I urge you to try them both. 

\*This cheesecake is intended to be enjoyed with no topping.  Its decadence stands on its own merit.  I'm not telling you not to use a topping, but I urge you to try a piece plain before making this decision.

\*This cheesecake is not healthy.  My mother used to say, ""A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.""  You have been warned.

\*The instructions for this recipe may seem oddly specific to you, but there is a reason for this.  I can tell you from experience that if you don't follow it as it is written, the consistency and texture will be lacking.  

\*I will NEVER buy graham cracker crumbs.  I do it the way my mother did, by buying graham crackers and crushing them.  The best way is to put them in a plastic zipper bag and crush them with a rolling pin or a drinking glass.  Any hard, cylindrical object will do the trick.  If you opt to use speculoos instead of graham crackers (which I find makes a superior crust) you will HAVE to crush them this way, as you can't just buy speculoo crumbs like you can graham cracker crumbs.

&#x200B;

With that said, without further adieu, on to the best cheesecake you've ever had!

&#x200B;

**Required equipment:**

\*Handheld electric mixer (stand mixer also will work, but is actually a bit less convenient in my experience)

\*10 inch springform pan

&#x200B;

**Make the crust first:**

**Ingredients:**

\*1/4 cup melted UNSALTED butter

\*2 tablespoons white sugar

\*2 cups graham cracker crumbs OR speculoo crumbs.  Speculoos are sold in the US under the Biscoff brand. I recommend speculoos for a more flavorful crust, but graham cracker is the original, tried-and-true crust. Using speculoos is the first of my two tweaks, and the one I use most often, almost every time.  The second, mentioned later, is dependent on how I feel that day.

**Directions:** 

Preheat oven to 350¬∞ F. Mix crumbs and sugar in a medium bowl.  Then add the melted butter and mix thoroughly, being sure to get the mixture consistent.  Press the mix into your springform pan, pressing against the sides to a height of about 1 inch or so. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and set aside to cool.  While the crust cools, mix the filling.

&#x200B;

**Make the filling:**

**Ingredients:**

\*3 8oz packages of cream cheese (total 24oz), left at room temp for about an hour.

\*1 1/2 cups white sugar

\*4 eggs

\*1 tablespoon grated lemon rind OR lime rind. This is the second tweak.  Both are equally good in my opinion, and provide different subtleties.  This ingredient, regardless of which you use, is what REALLY brings the magic into this recipe.  For what it's worth, I recommend trying the original (lemon) first. 

\*1/2 teaspoon real vanilla extract.  To use imitation is blasphemy.

**Directions... This is where things get specific.  I will put important aspects in bold:**

Place cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl.  Mix at **low speed for 30 seconds** to blend, turn up to **medium** and beat for **1 minute.** Scrape bowl with a rubber spatula, and mix at **medium speed for 1 more minute.**  Add eggs **one at a time,** mixing at **medium speed** for **15 seconds after each one.** Scrape bowl again.  Add your grated lemon (or lime) peel and vanilla.  Mix at **medium speed** for **30 seconds.** 

Pour filling into the springform pan over the prepared crust.  The filling will be higher than the top of your crust, this is normal.  Bake at 350¬∞ F for 45 to 60 minutes, or until it feels firm to the touch.  Some slight browning around the edges is normal.  Chill in the refrigerator for several hours.

&#x200B;

WARNING! MAY BE DEADLY TO DIABETICS!!! 

Just kidding.  But seriously, it's bad for you.  As desserts often are. 

&#x200B;

I'd love feedback, so please... if you enjoy this cheesecake, have tips, or find a good tweak... message me or comment here.  I'd love to hear your opinions. 

**ENJOY!**",2019-12-30
Strawberry cake idea any tips ? >,"i thought to make a cake for my work for my birthday, and since it's strawberry season now, i thought of this strawberry cake, tell me what u think

For the Cream -

mix 1 can condensed milk + half a cup of water + (2 boxes of whipped cream).

For the Strawberry Cream -

2 boxes of strawberry 1 puree and 1 fresh and cut to strips.

For the Cake middle -

Just bought sponge cake circles

For the Base -

Either Biscuit with Butter or if i really want to impress then Egg Whites that's been in the oven for 2 hours on very low heat. (in shape of circle like cake. and thin) (marenque i think)

then to mix it like

marenque base >

on top of it white cream >

on top of it strawberry puree >

on top of it cake base >

on top white cream >

on top strawberry puree >

on top cake base.. etc...

and ontop the fresh strawberries that's cut.

that's it... thought it could be an impressive relatively easy cake.

what're your thoughts on that?

i mean the top would look amazing, the sides will look horrible... but i guess it's tasty.

Sean's famous Mac and Cheese,"Hello! Alchemist here again, and as you've inferred from the title, my real name is Sean.  This is a recipe I make almost every week.  It's one of my favorite comfort foods, and has become somewhat of a legend in my circle.  I've had countless people ask for this recipe after eating it (and I always happily give it out), and I'd like to share it here.

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:** 

\*3 tablespoons butter

\*1/4 cup flour

\*1 teaspoon salt

\*1/2 teaspoon dry mustard

\*1/4 teaspoon black pepper

\*2 1/2 cups milk

\*1 pound chedder cheese, grated

\*1/2 pound Velveeta, cut into chunks

\*1/2 pound mozzarella, grated

\*1 pound elbow macaroni

\*Bread crumbs

\*Paprika

**Directions:**

Preheat oven to 350.  Fill a large pot with water for the macaroni.  Begin heating the water as you make the cheese mixture, simply adding the macaroni whenever the water begins boiling and keeping an eye on it while you continue with the cheese mixture. Meanwhile, place the butter in a medium or large sauce pan and melt it over low heat.  While it melts, mix the flour, salt, mustard, and pepper in a small bowl.  When the butter is fully melted, add the flour and spices, remove the pan from the heat, and mix until you get a consistent paste. Next, return the pan to the heat and begin adding the milk.  You must add the milk in SMALL amounts, as in less than 1/4 cup at a time, and mix fully after each addition.  If you add too much all at once, your flour mixture will form clumps that are very difficult to get rid of.  Once all of the milk has been added, allow this mixture to simmer, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes. Then begin adding your cheeses, but reserve a half a pound of the cheddar.  How much you add at a time is unimportant, but I prefer about a handful at a time, allowing for it to melt before adding more.  You can turn the heat to medium-low for this step to speed up melting.  Be sure to stir often, taking care to scrape the bottom... Otherwise you will have a thick layer that settles and sticks to to the bottom. Don't forget to be watching your macaroni, which can be drained and poured into a 9x13 baking dish whenever it is ready.  When all of your cheese (except the half pound of cheddar you set aside) is fully melted and mixed, pour the mixture into the pan with the macaroni and mix.  Alternatively, you can put the cooked macaroni into the pan you boiled it in, add the cheese mixture to that, and mix it there before putting it in the baking dish. This just makes it easier to mix without spilling.  Sprinkle the remaining cheddar evenly over the top of the dish, followed by a layer of bread crumbs.  Finally, sprinkle a little paprika over the top (this is mostly for garnish).  Bake at 350 for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the edges are bubbly and the bread crumbs start to brown.  Remove and cool for 5 minutes before serving.  Pair with chicken or steak, and I recommend a nice craft beer with it. 

&#x200B;

"How to tell when is garlic ""fragrant"" after adding to hot oil?","A lot of recipes (Cooks Illustrated in particular) say to cook garlic (and ginger) until fragrant.

I understand that you want to make sure not to cook it too long, so that's why they specify. To me, though, it's pretty fragrant raw, and I'm not sure how to tell the difference between the raw fragrance and the cooked-enough fragrance.

I'm usually pretty conservative about it, so I'll mix in whatever else the recipe calls for sooner rather than later, but I'm wondering if maybe I'm getting less flavor than I could be.

This question has been bugging me for a while, and damn if I'm going to let another year go by before getting it answered! Thanks!",2019-12-31

[Happy 2020 Icing Cookies](https://preview.redd.it/m7s65qb6qa841.jpg?width=1826&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f37b7f42cee6134627d65cb9dce7f0e4dfe36f9)

Happy New Year everyone! Cheers to my first working day in 2020 (trust me, I am not that excited at all lol üòÖüòÖüòÖ). I made a few sets of **2020 New Year Icing Cookies** üç™üç™üç™ for my friends and family‚ù§Ô∏è I just use a basic cookie recipe as the base, royal icing and edible gold paint for decoration. You will be amazed at how much a little icing outlining can pretty up a cookie. Don‚Äôt let the writing part intimidate you, it comes naturally‚úåüèºIf you aren‚Äôt quite confident with piping, just use edible writing pens, they come in different colours. Nothing is more comfortable than your own natural motions.¬† Just relax and don‚Äôt over think itüí™üèº

**Full video tutorial:** [**here**](https://youtu.be/ZIkPUazd8hg)

**INGREDIENTS**

Cookies: Just use your favourite cookie recipe

Wilton meringue powder

Charcoal powder ‚Äì to make black icing

Deco-relief metallic sand gold colouring

Edible black writing pen

**STEPS**

This easy royal icing recipe is hardly 3 steps and can be easily coloured!

1. Beat all ingredients (3 tablespoons meringue powder, 4 cups icing sugar and 5 tablespoons warm water) together until icing forms peaks (7-10 minutes at low speed with a heavy-duty mixer, 10-12 minutes at high speed with a hand-held mixer).
2. Add water slowly until the desired consistency is reached.
3. Separate into bowls and add food colouring!

* For stiff icing consistency: Use 1 tablespoon less water.
* For flood icing consistency: Add 1 teaspoon water per cup of royal icing and add water slowly until you can see the icing is quite liquid and thin.

**Decoration**

1. Outline each cookie using thin consistency white royal icing
2. Fill the 2020 cookies using stiff consistency white royal icing and fill the rest with thin consistency white royal icing
3. After you filled each cookie, tap the cookie slightly (be gentle‚Ä¶don‚Äôt break the cookies) to take out the air bubbles
4. For 2020 cookies, use a ball tool to make some holes on the icing surface
5. Chill the cookies at room temperature until dry. I used a food dehydrator to speed up the process, it took around 20-30 minutes
6. Dilute the gold paint with alcohol (I used Volka)
7. Paint the cookies with two coats of gold paint, the colour will be more vibrant with 2 coats
8. Create different texture with different brush, I only slight brushed on the gold paint on star (thin brush) and plaque shaped cookies (flat blush)
9. Use black icing to write on cookies and decorate the ribbon
10. I used the edible writing pen to write ‚ÄòSubscribe‚Äô and ‚ÄòFB/IG/YT‚Äô
11. I used royal black icing to write ‚ÄòBakeBud‚Äô and ‚ÄòHappy New Year‚Äô
12. Cool completely

Lemon Chicken Casserole - the king of comfort food!,"I don't have a picture of this at the moment, but it's not the most glamorous looking dish anyway.  However, it's some of the most delicious comfort food out there and like many casseroles, is even better the next day.  Anyway, on to the recipe!

&nbsp;

**EQUIPMENT**

* 10x6 baking dish

* Pot for poaching chick (if not buying grocery store rotisserie chicken)

* Mixing bowl (optional)

* Oven

&nbsp;

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1.5 - 2 lbs Chicken Breast

* 1 10.5 Can Cream of Chicken soup (or Cream of Celery).

* 1 Small yellow onion. Roughly diced.

* 2-3 Celery ribs. Roughly diced.

* 4 Tbsp Mayonnaise

* 1 Cup Shredded cheese. DIvided (we like the ""Mexican"" blend, but you do you)

* Juice of half a lemon

* 2 tsp lemon pepper

* .5 tsp paprika

* 1 Cup potato chips. Lightly crushed

* White rice for serving

&nbsp;

**DIRECTIONS**

1. Preheat oven to 425* 

2. Fill a pot with water and add chicken breasts and some dried herbs (think sage, thyme, rosemary) and some pepper. Cook over medium heat until chicken reads as done on an instant read thermometer, and then set aside to cool for a bit and shred when you can handle it.

3. In a mixing bowl (or directly into baking/casserole dish), add the shredded chicken, onion, celery, soup, mayo, lemon juice, lemon pepper, paprika and ~1/3 of the cheese and stir to combine.

4. Pour into baking dish in an even layer, cover with remaining cheese and then top with crushed potato chips.

5. Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until edges are bubbly and cheese has some browning on it.

6. Let sit for a moment and serve over rice!

&nbsp;

**ADDITIONAL NOTES**

* This recipe scales up really easily and we've often adjusted on the fly as I don't remember the exact measurements for the wet ingredients.

* You can use white or dark meat chicken, we've just always used breasts because that's the way my mom did it, but you do you.  Also, if you don't want the extra pot to clean, you can substitute with a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.",2020-01-02

**I used the recipe from Wagamama: Feed your Soul p.61**

**My Method**

1.¬†Place the vegetable oil into a big pan (big enough to handle a stir fry) add the chicken, seasoned with salt and white pepper and ginger to the frying pan and brown lightly.¬†

2. During the time the chicken is browning cut up the onion, spring onion. Add the onion, spring onion, prawns and bean sprouts to the pan and cook for a few minutes until the onion is at the desired softness. *At this point you could add whatever vegetable you would like as long as it would cook in a similar time to the onion.*¬†

3. Whilst everything is frying nicely cook the soba noodles to the packets instructions, mine needed boiling for 3 minutes. whilst the noodles are cooking combine the soy sauce and Worcester sauce and set aside.¬†*Soba noodles can be hard to find so could be replaced by vermicelli rice noodles.*

4. Once the noodles are cooked drain them and place them back in the pan (off of the heat), add your eggs and mix ensuring all of the noddles are covered, at this point I also added in some vegetable oil. Add the noodle mixture to the chicken and vegetables and combine. It is important to keep everything moving and on a low heat at this point. Cook for a few minutes and then add your soy sauce and wostershire sauce.

5. Plate your Yaki Soba and add the toppings.

For some more information and pictures of my process I've written about it here [https://gracelessliving.wordpress.com/2020/01/05/wagamama-recipe-yaki-soba/](https://gracelessliving.wordpress.com/2020/01/05/wagamama-recipe-yaki-soba/)",2020-01-05

Easy 5-minute rice kheer (Indian style rice pudding) recipe,"I'm aware that this does not taste as good as the real thing, but it does get rid of the craving for me and its much faster to prepare than the real thing. I really could not find a simplified version of this recipe so I ended up making my own. If you find a change for the recipe that you think makes it better, please let me know!

**Prep time:** 10-15 min

Makes about 1 1/2 cups or 2-3 servings.

&#x200B;

**Ingredients**

* 3/4 cups half-n-half
* 3/4 cups 5-minute rice
* 1 tbs sugar \*you can add more to taste\*
* 1/2 tbs cardamom
* (Optional sliced almonds)

**Directions**

1. In a pot mix half-n-half, sugar, and cardamom over medium-heat heat.
2. Once the sugar and cardamom are well incorporated and the milk is now warm add in your rice.
3. Cook the mixture for 5 minutes or until rice is tender stirring occasionally. If your milk begins to foam reduce the heat.
4. Once the rice is tender and your pudding has thickened removed the pudding from the heat.
5. If you prefer your pudding hot serve now. If you prefer it cold chill covered in the fridge for at least one hour before serving. Sprinkle almonds over the top just before eating.

**Notes:** You can keep your pudding in the fridge for up to 5 days after making it.

\- If you use lactose-free half-n-half don't add all the sugar at once and taste, as you stir it in as lactose-free varieties of milk, tend to be sweeter.",2020-01-06

My favourite dessert from Hong Kong - Mango Grapefruit Coconut Milk Sagoü•≠ü••üçä,"[Mango Grapefruit Coconut Milk Sago](https://preview.redd.it/2okc8htz3a941.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ea7a5c5e22aa343705a84d2ab1fdf3522910bf3)

**Mango Grapefruit Coconut Milk Sago**

Hi all, I would love to introduce my favourite Hong Kong dessert to you, Mango Grapefruit Coconut Milk Sago Ê•äÊîØÁîòÈú≤ü•≠ü••üçäIn HK, people use pomelo rather than grapefruit for this dessert but I am in Australia, it's just really seasonal to get pomelo here, so the common substitute is grapefruit. Plus mangoes are in season now, so why not?! 

The steps are super simple. **Full video tutorial** [**here**](https://youtu.be/Muz8U6_8-Zk)**.**

**Ingredients**

* Sago 30g 
* 2 Mangoes 
* Water 100g 
* Sugar 100g 
* Coconut Milk 150g 
* Evaporated Milk 50g 
* Grapefruit & Lychee : as much as you like

Steps

1. Bring water to boil
2. Add sago into the water, bring to boil in medium heat for 5 mins, cover with lid and set aside for 10 mins
3. Drain out the sago, the sago should now become larger in size and translucent
4. Add sugar and water, stir until sugar disolves
5. Add in coconut milk, bring to simmer, remove from heat and then chill until it completely cools down
6. Blend mango into juice, leave some mango cubes
7. Put the mango juice into a large glass bowl, mix in the coconut milk, slowly add and mix the evaporated milk in
8. Add sago into the mixture
9. Put mango cubes and lychees at the bottom serving bowl, pour the mango mixture in
10. Put more mango cubes and lychees at the top before you serve

NOTE: this dessert must be served COLD! Not even room temperature or slightly chill. I recommend put it into fridge more at least 2 hours before serving. The flavour is much more vibrate when it is served cold enough.

Citrus chicken pasta,"Anyone know of any good recipes for a chicken pasta where squeezed orange/mandarin orange juice is used instead of lemon juice for the marinade, and maybe even incorporated into the creamy sauce? I was in Dominican Republic a few months back and had this delicious dish that was essentially a chicken fettuccine Alfredo, except the chicken had a strong savory and sweet citrus flavor as if marinated with orange juices instead of lemon, and I recall the sauce having a similar citrus element to it. It was amazing, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find any recipes similar to what I‚Äôve described. Just about all searches for citrus marinades turn up your standard ones using lemon juice. I would love to recreate this pasta if it sounds familiar to anyone. Thanks for the help!",2020-01-07

Does anyone have suggestions for light sauce or flavorings I can use on them? Not something heavy like a tomato sauce or alfredo sauce that totally covers it. I currently do, like, a blurp of olive oil, and maybe shake on some garlic salt or lemon pepper.

Chives-mozarella chicken idea,"I've came up with an idea for a recipe, but I think it needs some improvement. I don't know if it belongs on this sub, but I hope it does. So, here goes.  


Ingredients:  
\-Chicken breast  
\-Mozarella (2 or 3 tablespoons)  
\-Chives (about a spoonfull, maybe less)  
\-Salt  
\-Pepper  
\-Olive oil  
\-Cream (I used 12% or 18% fat)  
\-Garlic  


Prep:  
1. Flatten the chicken breast, you can do it with a tenderizer but I prefer to place in on the cutting board and cut it about half a centimeter off the board while rotating it. This way it unfolds  
2. Salt and pepper on both sides  
3. Arrange chives and mozarella in the middle of the chicken, roll it and tie with a cooking string. It should form sort of a cylinder  
4. Lightly fry it on all sides  
5. Put it in a casserole dish, or any other over ready dish, and put into the oven heated for 200C/390F for 20 minutes  
6. About halfway through the cooking, pour a bit of a cream on it (depends on a size of your dish, 0,5 cm from the bottom of it), add a crushed clove of garlic to it  


Now, as for what was wrong:  
You couldn't really taste the chives, but that may be because I've been watching netflix while waiting and it was in the oven longer than it should.  
Cream got burned slightly, it was probably because of the time but I needed some moisture or the meat would turn out dry. I don't think I should cook it for a shorter time or it could be raw.  


So, anyone willing to do this experiment with me and help me fix it? Or is this idea for a recipe a waste of time?",2020-01-08

I tried to make potato pancakes and I failed miserably :(. I dont want to give up but I really followed the recipe and it didnt work. It tasted like onion quiet and it wouldnt cook from the inside only burn from the outside.,"Hello, 

I was working on a recipe I found online on Foodnetwork. 
I had the ingredients: 

1 egg
1 potato
1 flour
1 onion


I boiled my potato, mashed it, added an egg,
added onion, and flour. At the beginning it was pretty sticky, so I kept adding flour and kneading it. Anyhow, finally I was able to make my dough and then into circles shapes. As I put it on the pan, it would only burn from the side I flip to. Then it tasted so much like onion which was pretty bad. I tried to open the inside of it and it was still not cooked. Only dough. I felt pretty disappointed. Perhaps it was an issue with my proportions, maybe I needed more potato? 

I am planning to try again today but without onion. My plan is to mash the potato and add flour to it then knead  it  and roll in then fry it. 

I am debating if I should add egg to it or not? 

Thank you,",2020-01-09

One of the first recipe sites I frequented was ""[Allrecipes.com](https://Allrecipes.com),"" probably in the late '90s. I got a lot of good ideas from there since.

But in recent years most recipe sites I go to are not worth the effort. Popups, videos, links that take you somewhere other than where you expected are rendering them more trouble than they're worth.

Secret ingredient in BBQ rub,"I‚Äôve searched several bbq rub recipes of the typical brown sugar, salt, garlic, onion, mustard, and pepper blend trying to mimic the rub I have from an actual bbq restaurant.

I took pictures of 134 recipe cards while at my grandmother's house for Christmas. My daughter and I spent hours going through and picking the ones that sounded the best while searching for the two recipes I wanted most. My elementary school teacher's assistant Mrs. Ludy's cheesecake recipe. I thought for sure this one was the one since it had such lovely handwriting, but when I transcribed it, I realized it could not be as it does not contain cream cheese, but instead cottage cheese! If anyone makes this cake, please post a picture and let me know what its like. I'm very curious!

(Edit: A redditor on r/oldrecipes let me know it's  L√ºchow's and it's a restaurant in NYC!)

In the coastal regions, this is the king of fish dishes. Prepared in vast quantities for a family celebration, it combines the riches of the sea and the land in one big copper pot. Any firm-fleshed fish such as haddock, trout or sea bass will work here.

#### INGREDIENTS

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
* 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
* 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* leaves from a small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
* 2 liters fish stock or water
* 4‚Äì6 garlic cloves, finely sliced
* 2 x 400-g tins whole plum tomatoes, drained of juice
* 2‚Äì3 carrots, cut into matchsticks
* 2‚Äì3 courgettes, cut into matchsticks
* 1 kg firm-fleshed fish fillets
* 450 g uncooked prawns, shelled and deveined
* 450 g fresh mussels, cleaned
* 450 g scallops, shelled and cleaned
* sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* leaves from a small bunch of fresh coriander, finely chopped

**For the couscous:**

* 350 g couscous, rinsed and drained
* 400 ml of warm water
* 2 tablespoons olive or sunflower oil
* 25 g butter, broken into little pieces¬†

Serves 4‚Äì6

#### METHOD

1. Preheat the oven to 180¬∫C (350¬∫F) Gas 4.¬†
2. Tip the couscous grains into an ovenproof dish. Stir ¬Ω teaspoon salt into the water and pour it over the couscous. Set aside for about 20 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large copper pot, or very large heavy-based saucepan. Stir in the cumin and coriander seeds, turmeric and harissa paste. Add the parsley and pour in the fish stock. Bring the liquid to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the garlic, tomatoes, carrots, and courgettes and simmer for a further 10 minutes.¬†
4. Using your fingers, rub the oil into the couscous grains to break up the lumps and aerate them. Scatter the butter over the top and cover with a piece of foil or wet greaseproof paper. Place in the oven for about 15 minutes to heat through.
5. Add the fish and shellfish to the simmering broth and cook for 5‚Äì10 minutes, until the fish is flaky, the prawns opaque, and the shells of the mussels have opened (discard any that remain closed). Season to taste with salt and pepper and stir in a little coriander.
6. Fluff up the couscous with a fork and pile it onto a large serving plate in a domed mound. Spoon the fish and shellfish around the couscous and drizzle with a little of the broth. Ladle the rest of the broth into individual bowls and serve immediately.",2020-01-11

Spam and Egg Ramen: Costs next to nothing and is a lot more satisfying than plain ramen,"Spam and egg ramen (È§êËõãÈù¢) is a type of street food in Hong Kong, where it's usually sold as a breakfast or lunch item in roadside cafes and tea restaurants (Ëå∂È§êÂéÖ). Food stalls sometimes have it as well.

Makes 1 serving.

**Ingredients**

* ¬º tin of Spam or other luncheon meat. All brands have a similar flavour in my opinion so any will work.
* 1 large egg or 2 medium eggs.
* 1 pack of instant ramen. Can be any brand, but for best flavour, use the Nissin ""[Âá∫Ââç‰∏Ä‰∏Å](https://www.google.com/search?q=Âá∫Ââç‰∏Ä‰∏Å)"", which tends to be of higher quality and is what they'll give you in better mid-range restaurants in Hong Kong. You'll find this in Oriental stores and tends to be a bit more expensive than regular ramen because it's imported from Hong Kong.
   * Use the beef flavour.
   * If you want to be fancy, fresh ramen is good too. However, I don't have a recipe for the broth. Traditionally this dish is made with instant ramen.
* ¬Ω green onion, if desired.
* A small amount of sesame oil if you want. The Nissin ramen comes with a small packet of sesame oil.

**Preparation**

1. Pour 500 mL (2 cups) of water into a saucepan or small pot. You shouldn't use a pot that is so big that the water level drops below the height of the ramen packet. Bring to a boil.
2. Chop up the green onion into pieces around ¬Ω cm thick.
3. Cut the Spam or luncheon meat into thin slices around 1 cm thick. If you fail, it's no big deal. The shape of the slices is not too important, but thicker slices don't cook as well.
4. Put the ramen into the boiling water and *very lightly* grease a skillet with a small amount of vegetable oil. Heat up the skillet while the ramen cooks.
5. Once the skillet is hot, place the slices of meat into the skillet. Cook for around 60 to 90 seconds on each side. The meat should start to change colour on the outside to a mild pinkish-brown. Remove and place onto a plate.
6. Using the grease from the meat, crack the egg(s) into the skillet. Fry them for around 30 to 45 seconds before flipping them over and frying them again. Eggs may be cooked to preference but should never be sunnyside-up. You should get a sort of patty of egg that has the yolk in the middle. Put the eggs onto the plate of luncheon meat.
7. Use chopsticks or a fork to separate the square of ramen noodles. Add the soup base and the sesame oil (if any).
8. Add the eggs, green onion, and spam into the bowl.
9. Enjoy!",2020-01-12

Traditional Canton Turnip Cake (Lo Bak Go) üç∞‚ù§Ô∏è,"&#x200B;

[Lo Bak Go](https://preview.redd.it/xid74l7hx2b41.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6f8b12644a0d63870ac89b850defb2553b8ccab)

Chinese New Year is just around the corner! One of the many foods that I look forward to is homemade turnip cake. It‚Äôs pretty much the only time that my mum will make it herself. I have tried many of it at Chinese restaurants and I have concluded that my mum‚Äôs recipe is the bestüë©üèº‚Äçüç≥ü§£ It is mainly because the restaurant ones skipped a lot of fillings, they use a lot more powder, can‚Äôt really taste any turnip, just starch‚Ä¶ This recipe is not difficult at all, the prep work takes a bit of time because you need to grate the turnip, chop the ingredients and take a while to steam. It definitely worth the works tho! Both my mum and my mother-in-law said the **üèÜgolden rule is 1:5**, 1 serve of powders ingredients with 5 serves of turnip. I use 200g powder and 1kg turnip in the recipe. The cake turns out soft and full of turnip flavour. 

The [**steps**](https://youtu.be/DSNypDV-K9I) are very simple (just takes timeüòÖ)

Please follow me on FB and IG/YT for more recipes and baking tips üçìIt means a lot to me‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ

**Ingredients**

* 1kg Turnip 
* 2 Preserved meat sausages (around 80g)
* 1/2 Curled meat (around 45g) 
* 55g Dried shrimp 
* 60g Salted radish 
* 1 Shallot 
* 170g Rice flour 
* 4tbsp Wheat starch 
* 190ml Water 
* 1tsp White pepper 
* 1tsp Five spice powder 
* 1/2tsp Salt

**Steps**

1. Peel and grate the turnip, set aside
2. Bring water to boil, simmer the preserved meat sausages and curled meat for 3 minutes to soften them
3. Chop them up into small pieces (preserved meat sausages, curled meat, salted radish, dried shrimp and shallot)
4. Fry preserved meat sausages, curled meat, salted radish and dried shrimp over medium heat, set aside
5. Fry up shallots and add in the grated turnip, add in white pepper, five spice powder and salt, stir well
6. Add water into the pan, once it boils, bring down to simmer for 5 mins, cover with lid
7. Add rice flour and wheat starch into the pan
8. Remove pan from heat, mix all the powdery ingredients well with the turnip
9. Add in the fried up ingredients from step 4, mix well again
10. Divide the ingredients evenly between 2 foil pans
11. Steam for 45-60 minutes (stick a chopstick into the centre, if it comes out clean, then it is ready‚úåüèº)
12. Once ready, let it cool down completely
13. Slice the cake once it is fully cool down
14. Heat up a pan with a little bit of oil, fry the sliced cake and dig inüòãüòãüòã

**Note**: If you prefer a harder texture, you can adjust the recipe by increasing the powdery ingredients and a bit less water üë®üèº‚Äçüç≥üë®üèº‚Äçüç≥ My mother-in-law used a blender to grate the turnip once but the texture wasn‚Äôt exactly what we were after, however it was still flavoursome. I recommend only slicing the cake before you fry and serve it on the day ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥",2020-01-16

Bubba's Chicken Broth,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5d6n6t8aasc41.jpg?width=970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28251b9800263d0c406390939a05b9df713f4a07

&#x200B;

I know there is a rage out there for 'bone broth' lately. I thought I would share my bubba's recipe for old fashioned Jewish chicken broth. She used it to make her chicken soup with matzo balls. I watched her make it many times and since she never wrote a recipe I made my own notes:

2 - 3 lb whole roasting chicken

2 medium onions, halved through the stem end - remove the hairy roots but leave skin on

4 sticks of celery, cut in half

4 large carrot, - remove top and bottoms peel and cut in half

2 large whole parsnips, peeled

1 handful of parsley stalks and some with leaves

10 peppercorns

1 bay leaf

2 to 3 tsps kosher salt

Put the chickens in the largest lidded pot you own (about 5 quarts).

Add the rest of the ingredients and enough cold water to just cover them by about an inch or two.  Bring to a boil over a high heat. Skim off any foam and discard.

As soon as the water boils, turn the heat down to a very low simmer. Partially cover the pan and leave to cook gently for 2 to 3 hours, until the meat is falling off the bones. Do not let it boil. During the last 1/2 hour add 1 to 2 tsp kosher salt.

Remove the chicken and vegetables from the pot. Pour the broth through a sieve into a large bowl. Discard the bay leaf, parsley, onions and peppercorns. Leave the the chicken on platter to cool then remove the meat. Keep the bones. Store the chicken meat in the frig till later. Cut the carrots and parsnips into diagonal slices. Store in the frig till ready to serve

Pour the strained broth back into the pot. Taste and season with a little extra kosher salt if needed. Return the stripped bones and cartilage to the pot and simmer for another hour. Strain again in bowl and discard bones.

Cool the broth, cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, skim off the fat from the surface. Do not discard the fat (schmaltz) keep it in a sealed jar in the frig for roast potatoes.

If you think it needs more flavour, boil it rapidly for about 10 to 15 mins to reduce water content. Serve  it heated with the warm reserved chicken and vegetables. You can add cooked noodles if you want.

NOTES: My bubba used kosher chicken but I would recommend using organic chicken and vegetables since you will simmering this for a long time. Organic keeps any ""bad"" stuff out of your soup.",2020-01-18

Egg variations for picky eater ?,"Hi ! I was wondering if anyone could recommend something for me - different types of egg dishes/ ways to cook eggs ? I‚Äôve never really liked eggs that much and only like to eat them in combination with few foods, but foods that basically cover up the egg taste lol. 

For example i like spam and egg, actually there the egg can even taste good sometimes. I like bacon egg and cheese‚Äôs as well so i guess i do like eggs in combination with that kind of meat ? I don‚Äôt really like omelets at all, scrambled eggs i can only eat a little of depending on what i have it with and don‚Äôt enjoy that much. I‚Äôve had over easy and it‚Äôs not bad if it‚Äôs done well, with either toasted bread or something.  So i guess i mostly prefer fried egg ? But I‚Äôm open to trying other variations

lol so If any of this information helps some one recommend me various egg dishes i may like, that would be great ! I mainly want to eat them as means to gain a little weight and add some egg based meal to my breakfast which is just a fruit smoothie with whey powder

Thanks !",2020-01-23

Salmon Croquettes Recipe,"Hello, was wondering if anyone could help with a recipe or at least an idea. 

So when I was a kid my grandmother used to make what she called Salmon Croquettes and when she died I never got the recipe, even though she always told me one day she would teach me how she made them, we just never got around to it.

I've looked up several different recipes throughout the years to try and recreate them and never seems right. From what I could remember was the coating was very thing and nicely browned - I'm assuming just breadcrumbs, because I tried cornmeal and way to dense and hard. Always canned salmon. Mix and formed in oblong oval balls instead of the usual patty form. Mix with eggs and I think maybe mayo or milk/buttermilk? No clue if she used seasoning or any other mix in. Rolled in breadcrumbs and always refridged overnight and then fried in a shallow thing of oil. No vegs or anything besides salmon inside from what I can remember. 

Now I have tried making them with like I said cornmeal, no go there. Mixed with mayo, Worcestershire sauce, onions, eggs, milk, and some seasonings. Didn't taste good or right. That was my last try. I know I can and have looked on google and none of the recipes I have tried or read seem like a good fit.

Just wondering if anyone ever came across anything similar? Thanks.",2020-01-26

 Prep Time: 5 Minutes  
Cook Time: 10 Minutes  
Quantity: 2 Servings

### Ingredients

* ¬º kilogram of Maize flour
* 2 teaspoonfuls of cooking oil
* 100ml of milk
* Half jug of Water

### Instructions step by step

1. 3-4 cups of water should be poured to a large deep pan popularly known as the sufuria.
2. ¬†2 teaspoonfuls of cooking oil should be added to the water.
3. ¬† A little amount of milk just to change the colour of water.
4. ¬†The mixture should be put on fire and allowed to boil completely.¬†
5. ¬†After boiling, one to cups of maize meal flour should be added.
6. ¬†More boiling should be allowed after adding maize flour until the boiling water overcomes the flour.
7. ¬†Star mixing with a wooden cooking stick to make the mixture thick. The mixture should be mixed completely and with time, it becomes sticky.
8. ¬†With each stirring, little amounts of flour could be added to attain the intended thickness.
9. ¬†After 3 minutes, the mixture will become heavy and stick at the bottom of the deep pan.
10. ¬†It should be turned round and each side allowed to cook for about 2 minutes.
11. ¬†Fire should be reduced at this stage and cooking allowed until a cooking aroma is achieved.
12. ¬†The cooked cornmeal should be pressed at the middle of the deep pan and made into a round shape.
13. ¬†It should be emptied to a tray and the deep pan removed as it is now ready.
14. ¬†It should be served when hot with a stew of your choice, preferably fried chicken and spinach.

"Hey everyone, here in France, on the 2nd of February we celebrate ""La Chandeleur"" (Candlemas), where it's traditional to eat cr√™pes for an entire day so I wanted to share my family's recipe so you guys can celebrate too!","As well as being delicious, this cr√™pe batter is superior to other batters because you don't need to let it rest before making cr√™pes and you don't need to butter the pan between each cr√™pe.

If you're interested, I've made a whole video on the history of Candlemas and how to make cr√™pes, which you can checkout here: [https://youtu.be/ddqvAM1AAyg](https://youtu.be/ddqvAM1AAyg)

Otherwise, here is the recipe.

For 24 cr√™pes, you will need:

\- 250g of All Purpose White Flour (2 cups)

\- 60g of Butter (1/2 stick of butter)

\- 5g of Salt (1 and 1/4 teaspoon of salt)

\- 6 Whole Eggs

\- 600ml of Milk (2.5 cups)

\- 4tbsp of Water

\- 4tsp of a Strong Liquor (such as Cognac or a Dark Rum)

&#x200B;

(The original recipe asked for twice as much salt but that was too much. If the cr√™pes feel bland, add a pinch of salt.)

1. Heat your milk on a medium-low stove up until it's just about to boil. Do not let it boil as milk spills over very easily.
2. While your milk is heating, put your flour in a large bowl, make a hole in the middle, break your eggs into it, and whisk them together. When the flour and eggs are well combined, add the water, salt, and liquor, and whisk again.
3. When your milk is warm enough, take it off the stove, add the butter and mix them together. When the butter is melted, slowly pour it into your batter while vigorously whisking the batter as to avoid forming lumps.

Voil√†! Your dough is now ready. As I've said before, you can immediately use it to make cr√™pes, which are a great and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.

To make a nice cr√™pe, take a shallow and wide pan (22 cm/8.5 inches) and put it on high heat. Put some butter in the pan and once it's melted, grease the whole pan with a piece of paper. You only need to butter the pan for its first cr√™pe.   When the pan is nice and hot, take your batter, whisk it again to mix incorporate any flour that fell to the bottom (I recommend doing that regularly), take a large scoop of batter and pour it onto your warm pan. Spread it evenly, let it stick a second or two, and then pour any excess batter back into the bowl.

Let the cr√™pe cook for a couple of minutes. Once the cr√™pe sticks off by itself, you can flip it. I recommend just picking it up with your fingers for that. Let it cook for a minute or two on the other side and enjoy it warm with any spread you like.

As a topping, I strongly recommend trying out ""Cr√®me de Marron"" or brown sugar with lemon.

Bon app√©tit!

&#x200B;

I really hope you give these a try. They are tasty, easy and fun to make and you can put any toppings you like on them so it's really a great way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.",2020-01-27

Nana's Chocolate Chip Cake,"This is a cake recipe that's always really popular wherever I take it, and the hardest part is getting it out of the pan (and making it last long after it's out).

INGREDIENTS:

‚Ä¢1 box of Yellow Cake mix (we use Betty Crocker, but you don't have to)

‚Ä¢1 small package instant chocolate pudding mix (small being the 3.9 or 4oz box)

‚Ä¢3/4 cup water

‚Ä¢3/4 cup vegetable oil

‚Ä¢3 eggs

‚Ä¢8oz sour cream

‚Ä¢1 tsp vanilla extract

‚Ä¢3/4 cup chocolate chips (this is a recommended amount. Follow your heart for proper amounts of chocolate chips, always)

INSTRUCTIONS:

Preheat oven to 350¬∞F/~177¬∞C

Mix all of the ingredients together, except chocolate chips. Once mixed smooth, fold in the chocolate chips.

Pour into a greased Bundt pan. You can dust with flour, but the flour will discolour the outside of the cake so, while it will still taste delicious, it won't look as pretty. If you don't have Crisco or some other form of baking grease/shortening on hand, my mom has used cooking spray with mixed results as well.

Bake for 45 minutes, or until the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the pan slightly. The toothpick test (supposedly) doesn't really work with this because of the chocolate chips, but I always do it anyways because it's easy to tell the difference between batter and melted chocolate chips in my opinion. And also I get to lick the toothpick. Or butter knife.

I usually end up losing a little off of the top when I pull this out of the pan, but people are usually too busy eating it to care what it looks like. Just make sure to wait 1 or 2 hours before trying to remove the cake, so it has time to cool. Otherwise, you'll end up with a giant mess.

I've also been told that it's important that everyone know that the titular Nana is from the south, so it's pronounced ""Nah-Nah"".

Beignets,"My mom used to make us beignets growing up and they are now my go-to addition for special breakfasts! I hope you love them as much as I do. 

&#x200B;

**Ingredients** 

* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup butter or regular margarine 
* 1 cup water
* 1-1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
* 4 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Vegetable oil for frying 
* Powdered sugar for topping

&#x200B;

**Directions**

1. In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, salt, butter, and water.  Bring to a boil and allow the butter to melt. Remove from heat and add flour all at once. Beat with a wooden spoon until all of the flour is moistened. 
2. Cook over medium heat, beating until flour leaves the sides of the saucepan and forms a ball (this usually takes only a few minutes).  Remove from heat. 
3. Transfer mixture to large mixing bowl.  Add eggs, one at a time while mixer is on a medium speed. Continue beating until mixture is smooth.  Beat in vanilla.
4. In a large pan, add in roughly 1.5 to 2 inches of vegetable oil.  Heat on medium temperature until you feel the warmth when holding your hand above the pan. DO NOT ALLOW THE OIL TO FULLY BOIL. This is a fire hazard. 
5. Use a tablespoon to transfer ""clumps"" of the mixture from the mixing bowl to the frying pan. Once the mixture floats to the top of the oil, flip it over using a clean spoon (usually using a spoon with holes is ideal but I have successfully and carefully used a regular spoon in the past). Cook until beignet is a golden brown color. 
6. Carefully transfer cooked beignet to a bowl with paper towels. 
7. Add powdered sugar and enjoy! Please let me know if you have any questions! The most difficult process is the frying but they are so worth it!

2 TBSP chopped garlic

1 TBSP Worcestershire sauce

1/2 TBSP soy sauce

1 TBSP cayenne pepper ( could use more to be a little spicier or less to be less spicy)

I mixed all of this together and then formed them into \~150g patties and then I cooked that in a cast iron pan inside. I also put some coleslaw on it that I made at home.

Viet-Cajun Crawfish Paste Recipe,"Anyone have a good recipe for how to make a seasoning/paste to toss the crawfish in after they are boiled.

I've had this style here in Houston at various Vietnamese crawfish places. It's a buttery paste that seems gives them an awesome flavor.

Here is what i think is in them:

* Butter or Margarine
* Old bay seasoning
* Lemon pepper
* Paprika
* Lemon
* Minced garlic
* Something sweet (brown sugar maybe?)

Advice To Help Me Expand My Cookbook Collection,"Hey folks,

TL;DR - suggest some non-French and non-Asian cookbooks.

Long time lurker here - i have a pretty sizeable cookbook collection that I love - and i get pretty nerdy (Modernist Cuisine for example) but also pretty old school (eg.. Larousse Gastronomique and James Beard American Cookery). However, the overwhelming makeup of my cookbook collection is Asian and French and it's time I get more diversified. It's not that i don't have non-asian cookbooks but for every one book on Mexican food I have 4x on various asian dumplings.

To that end, I'd love great books to expand into the Italian, South & Central American, European/Russian, and so forth. So hit me with your best stuff - it doesn't need to be overwhelmingly popular or ""important"" but I don't mind if they do.

Shop everything except the cheddar and Bhut JolokiaEverything you just chopped + tomatoes in a saucepan, simmer on low heat for about 1 hour.  


Divide the Bhut Jolokia almost in the middle (so it stays in the stalk) and put it in the sauce. (it makes it easier to remove later)  
Let it simmer and taste at regular intervals.  
Add salt & pepper.  
When the strength is where you want it, you can easily remove the Bhut Jolokia.

Pour in a few tablespoons of white wine, taste.  
Remove from stove.  
Add in the cheddar, watch it slowly melt into the delicious sauce.  
Let cool.

Serve to whatever you want dipped, but feel free to have some yogurt nearby, it can get a little hot.

Creamy mushroom bisque. Even my gf who hates mushrooms said this was delicious.,"**Ingredients**

- 2 lbs. Assorted mushrooms, sliced thin, divided. You can do any kind you like - I did portabella, cremini and some button.

- 1 large shallot, minced. Yield is roughly 1/4 C

- 5-6 good sized cloves of garlic, minced

- 1 C white wine

- a bunch of thyme

- 1 bay leaf

- 1.5 quarts of stock - really any stock will work here

- 2 C of heavy cream

- couple splashes of worsheshire sauce

- either 2 Tbsp of cornstarch + 1 C of water or 2 Tbsp each of flour and butter


**Method**

**1.** Reserve 8 oz of the mushrooms for later. Preheat a dutch oven or large pot. Add oil and 1.5 lbs of your mushrooms. Mix them as they start to shrink from cooking, getting them in an even layer. Add a pinch of salt - you do this now to help pull moisture out of the mushrooms. Cook until all the water evaporates and the mushrooms start to get crispy on the edges. 


**2.** Add your shallots and garlic. Cook until they are softened and a bit of fond starts to form on the bottom. 


**3.** Deglaze with your white wine, scraping the bottom as you go. Add 4-5 springs of thyme. Reduce until au sec (meaning ""almost dry"").


**4.** Take this mixture and add it to your food processor, processing into a paste. Use about 1/4 C of your stock to help loosen things up.


**5.** Add your stock to the pot. Mix in your 
mushroom mixture and bring to a boil. Add your bay leaf and some more thyme. Add the heavy cream and let reduce for around 15 minutes.


**6.** For the cornstarch slurry method, simply add the cornstarch and water mixture to your soup and bring to a boil. 


For the burre manie method, dice the butter into very small pieces and toss in flour. Knead them together until a very thick paste forms. Place in a bowl. Add some of your soup to this paste and whisk thoroughly so no clumps are visible, then add to the soup. Cook for an additional 15-20 minutes to cook the flour.


If you want it thicker, add more slurry or buerre manie. If it gets too thick, add more stock.


**7.** Get a separate sautee pan very hot. Add oil and heat until it is smoking. Add your mushrooms, in several batches depending on the size of the pan. Cook until nicely browned. Season with salt and pepper and add to the soup.


**8.** Season the soup with salt, pepper, and worsheshire and taste. If it is a little flat, add a splash of vinegar (white wine, red wine or balsamic would be good). 


**9.** I serve this with a sprinkle of cotija cheese, croutons and chopped chives on top. For an even more indulgent soup, spoon into oven safe bowls, top with provolone or gruyere, and bake until",2020-01-31

Sharing my own Panko breaded chicken tenders recipe-,"  \*\* This chicken recipe will beat any fast food breaded chicken out there..!!

Use Chicken Tenders or cut small cube size (1/2 inch or ¬æ inch) cubes. (easy to fry) not too small or not too thick. 

Pat dry the breast ((I am talking about chicken breast here, not yours üòâ) with a paper towel to remove any surface moisture.

&#x200B;

1. Put salt to taste (based on your estimate) and massage the breasts. (again, I am talking about      chicken breast here üòä)
2. Sprinkle some fine      ground fresh black pepper.
3. Cumin  powder ( 1 tablespoon for 1 pound of chicken) will be good.
4. Garlic fine granules  powder  (not powder form)- 1 tablespoon for 1 pound of chicken.
5. Ginger powder (1/2 tlb)  spoon for 1 pound of chicken.
6. Red chilly powder (1/2 tlb) or 1 tlb (mild or medium) variety.

Massage these on the breast (I am talking about chicken breast here, not yours üòâ)

Let it sit for 15-30 mins.,

In a bowl ‚Äì mix approx. 3 tlbs of Tapioca starch (some stores it sold as Tapioca flour) and with  room temp water about ( ¬Ω  cup water) or less than buttermilk consistency.. (not too thick.. not too watery).The mix should be milk or buttermilk consistency.  You may find some tapioca starch at the bottom of the mix., try to mix it well so there is no residue left at the bottom.

Lay on the  half side of a plate some Panko Bread crumbs- (spread it on the plate), (don‚Äôt put too much at a time)..you may add more as you go on crumbing the chicken breast.

To Crumb the chicken pieces, first, dip the chicken in the tapioca starch mix, then roll with some finger pressure on the bread crumbs plate till it gets fully covered all over, then place it on a dry plate and

Continue doing with all the breast you have (on the plate, not elsewhere üòä)..!! (new repeat rinse this process till you roll all the breast pieces in the process.!!,

\*\* Note, while rolling the breast on the bread crumbs plate, you may wet the plate, and the crumbs may get mushy.. so try to minimize dripping (the tapioca mix, for god sake!! ) on the plate you are breading. This way, you will avoid clumping lumps of bread crumbs.

**Frying process**

1. Use a deep frying vessel   (use any cooking oil)‚Ä¶ **best would be peanut oil** or blended oil (canola) 
2. Pour enough oil in the  vessel to the depth level for frying.
3. Heat up the oil in  medium flame, let it heat up slowly.
4. Once the oil reaches a frying temperature, sprinkle some crumbs in it and see it floats to the      top and goes sizzling. Make sure you don't over heat the oil. Best way to heat up cooking oil is to use medium flame...
5. Lower the heat little  bit, but keep it to give you consistent heating temp
6. Drop the pieces of the   breaded chicken in the oil.. let it fry (it will float), then turn it      around so it gets cooked to a golden brown crispy color.
7. Use a frying spatula   with holes to drain oil, remove the pieces and let it sit on a plate lined      with paper towels to absorb any oil drips.
8. Serve it while hot, with  those chick-a-filla/wendys chicken nugget sauce (honey mustard/spicy hot      sauce) you stole or asked for extra packets to use later.
9. Note:- If your oil is  too hot, then you will burn up the breading and the chicken inside will      not cook completely. 
10. Note : -Don‚Äôt crowd the  vessel with too many pieces.. you need room to flip the pieces as they      cook. (average frying time is 5-8 mins) for 8-10 pieces at a time.

 Enjoy those chicken breasts!!",2020-01-31

"I'm in Rome and tried a few different pizzas, but kind of dissatisfied","First of all I'd like to say I respect Italian cuisine, it's clearly healthy and fresh in terms of ingredients. 

I've tried a few different places, and left disappointed with the pizza. Most were floppy and not crispy at all, also quite moist in terms of oil/water. That was a surprise as I expected crispy bases. 

I assume different regions in Italy make different styles of pizza so maybe just the city I'm in. 

Also a huge bummer was the lack of flavour, they were mostly a bit bland. Flavour is flavour, no matter where you go, when you experience rich tastes and flavours it's always a pleasure, I just say this as I don't mean I wanted more salt but maybe I expected the tomato sauce to have a richer taste, I heared so much about the taste of tomatoes here. 

I'm from the UK by the way. So I'm not comparing it to American pizza's. Here in Rome Ive tried expensive pizza restaurants to local pizzarias to the bakery/cafe around the corner so I got a wide range of prices and styles. 

Ern, yeah... I feel like it's one of those things where I've just not tried the best hidden gem pizza's.",2020-02-01

"I just successfully made a banana bread and it tasted so good. My question is, may I repeat the same batter but instead use another type of fruit instead?","Hi, 

I just made a delicious banana bread for the first time with this recipe: 

2 bananas
2 eggs
1.5 cup of flour
0.5 cup of sugar
1.5 spoon of baking powder 

And I baked  it in the oven. 

Now my inquiry is: may I, instead of banana use for instance orange or kiwi or mango? Chop it off and add it to the batter. Mix it well and bake it? 

Thank you,",2020-02-02

Monkey Bread,"This is a super easy breakfast recipe that's always a hit in my house. I wasn't sure how to flair this, but it's also super inexpensive, and usually all I have to actually go out an buy is the biscuits, since I keep the rest on hand.

INGREDIENTS:

‚Ä¢4 cans of premade biscuits (I use those cheap store-brand ones, but almost any brand will work. Just don't get the super flakey or layered/peel apart ones)

‚Ä¢Cinnamon sugar (the recipe that I have uses specific measurements for this, but they're weird measurements, and I always feel like I'm scraping the bottom of the bowl to get a good coating on the last few dough bits. I usually just dump out the cinnamon sugar that I keep in a container for toast and use that)

PUT THESE INGREDIENTS TO THE SIDE:

‚Ä¢1 cup packed brown sugar

‚Ä¢¬Ω cup butter

‚Ä¢1 tsp. cinnamon¬†

INSTRUCTIONS:

‚Ä¢Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

‚Ä¢Place or make cinnamon sugar in a small bowl. 

‚Ä¢Open each tube of biscuits and cut each biscuit into fourths.

‚Ä¢Roll into balls, coat with cinnamon sugar mixture and place in a greased Bundt or loaf pan. (For grease, just use cooking spray or Crisco. You do not flour the pan)

‚Ä¢Set to the side, grab the ingredients you put off earlier.

‚Ä¢Melt brown sugar, butter and cinnamon in a sauce pan over medium-high heat. My stovetop goes up to 10, and I'm higher altitude, so medium-high for me is about a 7.

‚Ä¢Bring to a boil and boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. 

‚Ä¢Pour over the dough balls, making a fairly even layer.

‚Ä¢Bake 30 minutes.

It should come right out of the pan after baking, and while it will be hot, you can eat it right away. We call it monkey bread because you pull the balls apart using your hands, and eat it like that.

Hope you all enjoy! Now I have to go make breakfast üòâ

Happy baking! ‚ù§Ô∏è",2020-02-03

Well we started with: 

1 liter of milk
2 eggs
Few slices of bread
.5 cup of sugar
 
We mixed them all together and then we made the caramel sauce which is quiet literally basic

Sugar and water. Boil them until the sugar looks brown. Then add the batter to it. And we put it all together in the oven for an hour.

***PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES*** 

1. Preheat oven to 175C and line a baking tray with baking paper 
2. Beat pumpkin puree, peanut butter and eggs on medium-high until well combined (I used the paddle attachment with my handheld stick blender)
3. Add flour in and beat at low speed just until incorporated
4. Working on a lightly floured surface, add the additional flour in, and knead the dough 3-4 times until it comes together
5. Roll the dough to 1/4-inch thickness
6. Using cookie cutters cut out desired shapes and place onto the prepared baking sheet
7. Place into oven and bake until the edges are golden brown, about 20-25 min
8. Let cool completely

**NOTE**: I used paper cookie moulds in the video so I could  cut a few different bone shape sizes without buying 3 different cookie cutters. I cut the rest of the cookies in small squared shape becasue that's how I like to reward my baby normally, consistent with her other treat sizes and just really easy to store them in a container!

Shakshuka Recipe,"Here‚Äôs my recipe for shakshuka, an Israeli-Tunisian-Moroccan egg dish. You can eat it for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner.... 

Ingredients: 
Olive oil 
3 eggs 
Kosher salt 
Black pepper 
Oregano 
Garlic powder 
Thyme 
Mint
1 chicken sausage 
Half an onion, white 
1 red bell pepper 
3 garlic cloves 
1 tomatoes 
28 oz garlic or mushroom tomato sauce 
1 jelapenpo pepper 
Half eggplant 
Cilantro 

Make sure to use only fresh ingredients!!

Instructions: 
Preheat half a cup of olive oil 
Cut the onion into thin strips. To avoid tears, wear glasses. 
Cut the bell pepper into strips. 
Cut the jelapano into thin rings 
Cut the sausage into rings 
Cut eggplant into into strips 

Throw everything into skillet. Medium high heat. 
Cook for 5-10 minutes until brown. 

Meantime, 
Cut tomato into wedges. 

When the onion/pepper/sausage is ready, throw tomato wedges into the pan. 
Stir and then add the spices. Usually, Shakshuka is cooked with an assortment of North African spices (like cumin and paprika), but this recipe is Italian inspired....  Anyway, it‚Äôs Mediterranean. 

After 10 minutes, add the tomato sauce. Stir for 10 minutes. It‚Äôs very important that the stew doesn‚Äôt become too hard. So if you see that it becomes too dry, add a tablespoon of water. But don‚Äôt overdo. Otherwise it will taste like tap water 

After 10 minutes, make three little holes (egg size) in the stew, break the eggs and put them into the stew. After a minute, mix the white around the yellow with a fork. Leave and let stir for 5 minutes, or more, depending on how you like your eggs. 

Add cilantro leaves. Meaning, no stem. 
Add feta 

Serve with toasted rye bread or challah.",2020-02-09

Nama chocolate is a smooth, rich, melts in your mouth type of chocolate. The good news is, it is super easy to make! This recipe is a homemade version of Royce Chocolate. You really only need four things: chocolate, whipping cream and butter. I made two layers with dark and white chocolate. If you made the white chocolate layer on top, you can put matcha powder on top, the flavours go really well together!üòãüòãüòãFull tutorial [**here**](https://youtu.be/mRYM7OYwUmI)

Please subscribe and follow me on FB BakeBud for more recipes and baking tips‚ù§Ô∏èIt means a lot to me

**INGREDIENTS**

* 150g Dark Chocolate
* 125g Whipping Cream
* 15g Unsalted Butter
* 180g White Chocolate
* 55g Whipping Cream
* 10g Unsalted Butter
* Cocoa Powder

**STEPS**

1. Chop up the dark chocolate (the dark chocolate as the first layer) into fine pieces
2. Put the chopped chocolate into a large glass bowl
3. Heat up the whipping cream, remove from heat when it simmers
4. Pour the whipping cream into the dark chocolate bowl
5. Whisk until the chocolate is melted, add in butter, mix well
6. Line the baking tray with baking paper and cling wrap
7. Pour the dark chocolate mixture in, spread it out evenly
8. Chill for 30 minutes in fridge
9. Repeat the exact same steps 1-7 for white chocolate, but the chilling time for white chocolate is 2 hours
10. Prepare your cutting knife, make sure it is warm and has 100% dry
11. Trim the edges of your chocolate board
12. Cut the chocolate into your desired shapes and sizes
13. Sprinkle cocoa powder or matcha powder on top!

**NOTE**: I soaked the knife into a hot water jug (as you can see in the video) before cutting the chocolate, you will have to dip it back into the water every now and then to keep it warm when you are cutting your chocolate. Just make sure you DRY the knife COMPLETELY every time. üî™When you cut the chocolate, do so by gently push the knife down. Don‚Äôt slide the chocolate, otherwise the edges won‚Äôt be clean. I wipe off the chocolate that sticked on the knife each time as well‚úåüèºGood luck‚ù§Ô∏èHappy Valentine‚Äôs Dayüë©‚Äç‚ù§‚Äçüë®üë©‚Äç‚ù§‚Äçüë©üë®‚Äç‚ù§‚Äçüë®

Best Chili Recipe Ever!!!,"3¬Ω pounds ground beef (use ground turkey if you prefer a healthier version)

Spices Round 1:

1 tablespoon ground cumin

1 tablespoon GOOD chili powder\* (mine is from a sidewalk dealer in Santa Fe, N.M.)

1 tablespoon parsley

1 tablespoon oregano

1 tablespoon basil

Brown and cook the ground meat until done. While the meat is cooking, add in the first round of spices. I find this allows the flavors to get into the meat.

I often uses Badia or Whiskey Island spices. I also find McCormick's Gourmet Collection of consistent, good quality, I prefer New Mexico and South American chili powders.  Any spice worth its name will always list the country of origin on the label.

1 large onion, coarsely chopped

1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped

1 large red bell pepper, coarsely chopped

1 large yellow pepper, coarsely chopped

3 cloves garlic, minced (or 1¬Ω teaspoons minced garlic or ¬Ω teaspoon garlic powder; feel free to add more garlic according to your taste)

Spices Round 2:

2 tablespoons oregano

2 tablespoons basil

3 tablespoons parsley

2 tablespoons chili powder

2 tablespoons ground cumin

1 teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more for ""heat"")

42.5 ounces canned whole tomatoes, chopped (or use diced tomatoes; also, use more tomatoes as needed)

18 ounces canned tomato paste (add another 6-ounce can of tomato paste if mixture is not a good consistency)

2-3 (16-ounce) cans beans (use your favorites; I use a mix of light and dark red beans)

Add the vegetables to the meat and cook, mixing in the second round of spices, as well, until vegetables are tender.

After the mixture is fully cooked, stir in the tomatoes and tomato paste.

Mix in the beans. 

Simmer for 45-60 minutes.

Spices Round 3:

Chili powder

Ground cumin

Salt

Sugar

This is the point at which you make my chili your chili.

While the chili simmers, taste and add the seasonings according to your preference. Please be careful with the salt.  If you add too much salt you may not actually taste it till later because when you are making the chili your taste buds sometimes can‚Äôt differentiate the salt levels because of the spices.

I usually add 3-4 tablespoons sugar to offset the acidic bite of the tomato products, I also use sugar to play games with my chili.

Four to 6 tablespoons cuts the acid and tames the heat, he said, resulting in a sweeter chili that has a kick.

Toppings:

Shredded cheddar cheese

Chopped red onions

Sour cream",2020-02-13

   * ¬º medium red onion, diced
   * ¬º medium tomato, diced and seeded
   * 1 lime
   * ¬Ω tablespoon chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, pureed
   * 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
* Bacon
   * 1 lb. thick cut bacon
   * Light brown sugar
   * Cayenne pepper
* 1 bag shredded lettuce
* 4 freshly diced tomatoes (seeds removed!)
* 4 freshly sliced jalapenos (seeds removed!)
* 16 oz black beans
* 1 cup sour cream
* 1 cup refried beans

Optional:

* Chipotle ranch dressing
* 1 small bag Doritos Nacho Cheese, crumbled

**Directions:**

Potato Wedges:

Cut up the russet potatoes into eighths, they should resemble potato wedges. Place these in a single layer on a large baking tray. In a bowl, mix the olive oil, oregano, cayenne, cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Slather this mix onto the potatoes, then place them in the oven for 25 minutes at 400 degrees. After they are done, melt the butter and coat the wedges in melted butter and salt. 

Steak Tips:

In a small bowl, combine the garlic, oregano, paprika, cumin, chili powder, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Rub the meat with the lime juice, and then rub the seasonings into the meat. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and leave at room temperature for another 30 minutes. Slice the steak into cubes before cooking. Melt some butter on a skillet placed over a medium-high heat and sear the sirloin 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until it reaches medium rare consistency.

Queso:

Place cheese, cream, and butter in a saucepan over low heat. Heat until melted - stirring frequently. Stir in the green chiles, cumin, garlic salt, and the cayenne pepper once melted completely. Add more cayenne for taste if needed. Add less cream for thicker queso.

Guacamole:

In a bowl, use a fork to lightly mash the avocados with the lime juice from half of the lime, leaving the avocado as chunky as you like. Stir in the onion, tomatoes, chipotle puree and cilantro. Season to taste with salt and more lime juice, if needed. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 2 hours.

Bacon:

Line a baking pan with aluminum foil and set a cooling rack on top. Spray the cooling rack with a non-stick spray and set the bacon on top. Lightly dust with the light brown sugar and sprinkle a tiny amount of cayenne over it. Set in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20-30 minutes and then let cool. Chop up into bits.

**Assembly Instructions:**

Once the potato wedges are done, let sit until the butter and salt have settled. This should be no more than two minutes, as the nachos need to stay warm. Top with half of the queso, and then layer on the black beans. Layer on the steak tips after that, and then the rest of the queso. After that, top with bacon, then lettuce, tomatoes, and jalapenos. Scoop three equally sized scoops of the guacamole, refried beans, and sour cream on top.

Optionally, lightly dust with the Doritos Nacho Cheese crumbles and lightly drizzle with chipotle ranch.",2020-02-15

* add 4 tbsp of each mustard and honey and cook for a little bit
* add some cream if you want richer sauce

Super quick 10-minute shrimp alfredo!,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c54ru5gb5dh41.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d9f9b09e3ea55110047b60ab90890f2b2c39f33

I made this after rescuing a stray cat who got hit by a car a few weeks ago. I got home from the emergency vet at like 9pm, tired and hungry, and already has shrimp defrosting so here we are. This recipe is for a single person‚Äôs serving. Want to make it for another person? Just double everything.¬†

I was a walking zombie so I didn‚Äôt waste time chopping actual garlic or vegetables to add but I‚Äôm sure if you took the extra 3 minutes to prep some veggies to add, they‚Äôd be good to add with the shrimp and soften up at the same time.

This recipe could be way less calories (as it is below, it‚Äôs \~650) if you used less heavy cream, as that‚Äôs pretty calorie-dense. For one person‚Äôs serving, you could probably halve it or cut it by 1/3 if you‚Äôre not a particularly saucy person OR use half-and-half as a substitute for less calories. I know myself and I live for and cherish my heavy, creamy sauces so I made the choice I made.¬†

(The cat‚Äôs okay, we‚Äôre probably going to adopt her. We have a visit scheduled this week with her fosters.)

**Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:**

‚Äì 1 dry cup of your favorite pasta (mine was fusilli this time but next time, WHO KNOWS?)

‚Äì 5-7 medium shrimp, cut into pieces¬†¬†

*Don‚Äôt mutilate the shrimp, just slice each shrimp into 2-3 chunks.*

‚Äì ¬Ω cup of heavy cream

‚Äì 1 tsp of olive oil

‚Äì ¬Ω tsp. cayenne pepper¬†

‚Äì 1 tsp. dill¬†

‚Äì ¬Ω tsp. garlic powder (or a clove of actual chopped garlic if you‚Äôre not a lazy piece of garbage like me)¬†

‚Äì ¬Ω tsp. onion powder

‚Äì 1 tsp. chives

‚Äì As much salt and pepper as your heart desires.

**How:**

1. Mix your **cayenne**, half the **garlic powder** and **onion powder**, a gentle sprinkling of some of the **dill**, and ¬º tsp. each of **salt** and **pepper** with your chopped **shrimp**.¬†
2. Set a small pot of salted water to boil on medium heat. Once boiling, turn heat to medium-low and drop in your **pasta** of choice ‚Äì follow the instructions on the box or bag to cook al dente. Stir every minute or so.
3. While your **pasta** cooks, heat another small pot or saucepan on medium-low heat and slap that **olive oil** in there. Put your healthily seasoned **shrimp** in with the **olive oil**. Stir every minute for approximately 6 minutes, until the **shrimp** are pink. Some browned edges are okay. Change heat to low.
4. Once your **pasta** is to your desired consistency, drain that pot and rinse your **pasta** thoroughly with cold water. I don‚Äôt know why exactly you do this, it‚Äôs just ingrained in my being at this point. I think it's supposed to stop your pasta from cooking. It could do nothing. I don‚Äôt know. Dry the **pasta** as best you can by shaking in the drainer and set the **pasta** aside.
5. Pour the **heavy cream** over the **shrimp** and let it sit until it begins to slightly boil. Stir in the rest of the **chives** (*save a pinch as a garnish if you‚Äôre particularly fancy*), **onion powder**, **garlic powder**, and **dill** and continue stirring for 3-4 minutes, until your sauce is thick enough for your liking.¬†
6. Put your cooked **pasta** in with the sauce and mix thoroughly to coat. Keep the burner on the lowest setting (*without turning it off)*¬†to keep everything warm as you mix.¬†
7. Put that whole mess in a bowl and eat it.",2020-02-16

üåµButtercream Succulents Cakeüç∞,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/no4v5jabqmh41.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0229222f390c9b8cce3c6ae660805e0bcc430b14

I often spent hours on Pinterest looking at all that beautifully piped buttercream flowers and succulents. I have always admired people‚Äôs dedication and patience that goes into those delicate petals and leaves, so I finally tried it! Tried using different piping tips before, couldn't create the look that I have in my head...so yea...third time luck!!

[**Full tutorial here**](https://youtu.be/lAv4qnAWSvg)

**INGREDIENTS**  
*Chocolate Brownie Cake* \- Unsalted butter 300g, sugar 100g, eggs 4, melted dark chocolate 150g, flour 192g, baking powder 64g  
*Buttercream* ‚Äì Can use either store brought or make your own  
*Wilton Colours* \- Orange, Moss Green, Brown, Teal Blue, Black, Leave Green

**STEPS**  
**Chocolate Brownie** **Cake**

1. Preheat the oven at 160C
2. Add unsalted butter and sugar into a big bowl, mix well
3. Add the eggs, mix well
4. Add melted dark chocolate, mix well
5. Sift and add flour and cocoa, mix well
6. Lightly grease the cake moulds (5‚Äù) with butter
7. Pour into the prepared tin, leave 1-2cm at the top
8. Bake at 160C for 20 minutes
9. Leave to cool, then run a knife around the sides and remove from the tin

**Buttercream**

1. Divide 5 cups icing equally among five bowls.
2. Using Wilton icing color, mix the following colours:

* Bowl 1: Original colour
* Bowl 2: Orange
* Bowl 3: Moss green and brown
* Bowl 4: Teal Blue and black
* Bowl 5: Moss green and leave green

**Pipe succulents**

All succulents are piped on flower nail prepared with flower square. Once succulent is complete, remove flower from square, place flower on cake and apply new flower square to nail. Put all the succulents into the fridge for at least 1 hour.Sorry for the poorly named succulentsüòÖüòÖ I have put in the timing there so you can reference it back to the videoü•Ç  
\*\*Star Cactus Bush (01:35)\*\*Prepare decorating bag with tip 12. Stripe bag with orange; fill with original. Start with a flat round circle as base, pipe buttercream into a mounded shape (squeeze and pull away slightly), continue piping around the base, gradually decreasing petal size at start of new petal row. Stop when it ends up looking like a little bush.

**\*\*Echeveria (02:00)\*\*** Prepare decorating bag with tip 352. Stripe bag with orange; fill with green (moss green and brown). Pipe circle of pull-out leaves. Fill circle with pull-out leaves.

**\*\*Cebenese (02:40)\*\***Prepare decorating bag with tip 81. Stripe bag with orange; fill with blue (teal Blue and black). Pipe some buttercream in circle as the mound. Hold the decorating bag at a 45¬∞ angle to outer base edge of mound, with half-moon opening of tip inserted slightly in the icing dot, squeeze and lift up slightly as you release pressure for each petal. Repeat turning the flower nail as needed to form the first row of petals. Pipe a few more rows until you reach the desirable size.

**\*\*Tall Cactus Bush (03:36 uses tip 10, 04:10 uses tip 12)\*\*** Prepare decorating bag with tip 12. Fill with green (moss green and leave green). Pipe buttercream into a tall mounded shape as base. For each petal, squeeze and lift up slightly, continue piping and turning around the base. gradually decreasing petal size at start of new petal row. Stop when it ends up looking like a little bush.

**Frost the cake**  
Stack the two brownie cakes together with some buttercream in the middle. Frost the cake with original butter cream. You don‚Äôt need to frost it perfectly here because we want to create this rustic look and showing the brownie underneath.

**Assemble**

1. Squeeze a dot buttercream on the cake and gently put the succulents on top. You can arrange the succulents in whatever way you like.
2. Use Tip 1F to pipe some star cactus (assorted heights) around the succulents. I just use whatever colours left for the star cactus for colour consistency. However, you can also mix some brighter colours to ‚Äúbright up‚Äù the cake.
3. Use Tip 2 to pipe white dots down grooves of starts. Top with small flowers with Tip 224.",2020-02-18

Kimchi and Bibim Noodle Advice,"Hello, I am a student currently teaching myself to cook, and tonight I was planning to make this meal:

[https://www.hmart.com/recipe/post/bibim-noodles-spicy-cold-noodles/](https://www.hmart.com/recipe/post/bibim-noodles-spicy-cold-noodles/) 

I made kimchi for the first time this weekend, and although having tasted it myself and liking it, I don't think my family will love it. They have never had it before, and I think its strong smell might throw them off. What ways can I help them enjoy it more? I was thinking about pan frying it, I tried cooking it this way for breakfast by cooking it in some butter, coconut oil, and sesame oil, and I thought it was quite good that way. I have also thought about cooking the noodles, spreading the sauce across the noodles, and pan frying it with the kimchi, but I'm not sure whether that's a good idea or not. 

I'm open to any suggestions (I just cant make it too spicy as one of my family members isn't a fan of spicy food)!",2020-02-18

Dill weed,"I would like to direct your attention to the dill weed spice. It‚Äôs a great spice, hugely popular in former Soviet countries, Turkey and Israel. Not only does it have a funny name that sounds like ‚Äúdeal weed‚Äù but it also adds a distinctive flavor to every recipe. You can add it to your breakfast eggs, to salmon, cream cheese sandwich with salmon, chicken, potatoes and rice. 

Russians, who are obsessed with the dill weed, add it to sushi, soup, fajitas, and everything else. I never tried dill sushi, but they say it‚Äôs good. 

Dill weed goes well with garlic. It also goes well with thyme, which is another great spice, very popular in the Netherlands and Denmark. In Dutch bars they serve gin with thyme. By the way, it‚Äôs pronounced ‚Äútime‚Äù, as in I don‚Äôt have time for your thyme. I will try adding dill to vodka-tonic tonight, we‚Äôll see how that works. 

Try adding dill weed to your recipes, and let me know if you like it, hate it, or think it‚Äôs so-so.",2020-02-20

Request: no-sugar blueberry pie with grape juice,"When I was little, there was an older lady in our church who used to make blueberry pie. She gave my mother the recipe a very long time ago, but my mother lost it at some point and the woman has since passed away. 

Here's what my mom remembers about it: it was sweetened with red grape juice concentrate, not sugar, and was surprisingly simple. She has a vague inkling of a memory that the filling **might** have been cooked on the stove and then poured into the baked crust to set. Then she randomly had the thought that maybe it also had Jell-o in it (which might make sense if it was indeed cooked on the stove?). But she's not sure about that. The no-sugar and grape juice concentrate aspects are for sure though.

I currently have a pie in the oven that I made based on [this recipe](https://www.cooks.com/recipe/k44t746c/sugarless-blueberry-pie.html), which is the only juice-sweetened one I saw amongst the top Google results. Although there are lots of fancier versions, some of which I snagged for my recipe bookmarks while searching, I'm hoping that someone on reddit will have a recipe similar to the simple, delicious one I liked so much as a kid!",2020-02-21

New Cuisine Exploration Help,"Hello /r/recipes

I have been working a lot the past couple years at learning Italian and French cooking. However my girlfriend has some health issues, and I need to cook things with high fiber and low cholesterol. I need suggestions of new cuisines to explore.

&#x200B;

I also want to explore a cuisine where I can really work on new techniques/skills etc. I don't like to use recipes, I like to learn a process and master it. E.G. many french sauces use a set of techniques, and once you learn the techniques and the process of using them, you can apply it in many different ways. I also have been working on my knife skills so that would be good to keep working on to.

&#x200B;

TLDR

Please suggest cuisines with:

1. Low cholesterol
2. High Fiber
3. Rich set of techniques/skills to learn
4. Good knife skills practice

Thanks for your help!

&#x200B;

I also have been wanting to expand my knowledge of spices, and flavor pairings, so that could also be a good criteria. I've cooked indian food a bit before so something different would be nice",2020-02-21

 **Ingredients:**  3 large potatoes, pinch of salt and five tablespoons of cooking oil. 

 **Directions**

* To make the French fries of potatoes, first wash the potatoes well. Then with a knife, remove the upper rough portion of the potatoes. Now cut all the potatoes lengthwise and make some potatoes horizontal pieces.
* Boil the water in a pan and leave the potatoes inside. Give them the amount of salt as well. When the potatoes are cooked, the salt will be mixed into the potatoes.
* The potatoes are supposed as cooked in five to ten minutes. Drain on a sieve when done. Drain the water and place it on the tissue on a plate so that all the water drops. After 2/3 minutes, heat the iron griddle and pour the oil and fry the potatoes over medium heat. 
* You can see if it is fried. When fried, remove the potatoes from the oil and place them on the tissue so that the oil from the potatoes absorbs. Your French fries are ready to eat now. You can eat these delicious fries with some tomatoes sauce.",2020-02-22

I searched the internet for a web/iOS app that would help me get my recipe collection into a manageable system and allow me to enjoy cooking with different recipes. But wasn‚Äôt able to find something that checked all the boxes.

* Chia Seeds: Chia seeds give overnight oats the pudding-like texture and add extra health benefits to the mix, but feel free to leave them out if you are not a big fan.
* Add in butter, or nut butter to add that extra creaminess. common are Almond butter, Cashew butter, Pumpkin butter, sunflower seed butter or peanut butter add that savory-nutty flavor and a certain creaminess.
* For the liquid to bind them all together, use your favorite milk. For a dairy-free version of overnight oats, we use almond milk, coconut milk, or cashew milk.
* Fruit: This is where the magic happens, pick the added flavor from your fruit of choice, try going for fruits that will not get soggy overnight, good options we enjoy are Apples, Oranges, Berries (especially strawberries, goji berries, and cranberries), Kiwi, Pineapple, Banana, and shredded coconuts.
* For a Sweetener, you can decide also to leave out, depending on how sweet you want the dish to be, for our sweetener of choice you have honey, maple syrup, banana, dates, [stevia](https://draxe.com/stevia/), or [erythritol](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/news/what-erythritol-and-it-safe) will work.
* To top it all off, just sprinkle your spices on top of it all, we love using Cinnamon, cocoa powder, or pumpkin pie spice.

### Directions

* combine all chosen ingredients as specified into an 8oz. mason jar, or resealable container
* place in the fridge overnight

# Hot or Cold? why not both?

heat it in the microwave for a hot breakfast

Implements needed for pot roast?," Sorry if this is a dumb question or I posted in the wrong place. Recipes are appreciated, but I 'd also like to know more about implements, or specifically recipes that do not require the implements I do not own. Or, if these implements are required, I want to know which ones to buy. 

  I grew up with a single, vegetarian dad, so I never learned to cook. I've mastered simple recipes & vegetables, but meat has always seemed complicated to me. I've learned simple meat dishes & want to try others. Pot roast with potatoes is one of my favorite dishes. When I search recipes it usually says I need a dutch oven or slow cooker. I am wondering if it is possible to make a good roast in a regular over on a baking sheet, shallow dish or something? Or do I need to buy a dutch oven, slow cooker, or something else?

Easy recipes to add Chia seeds into your diet," 

* *Chia Gel*: Place ¬º cup seeds in 1 cup liquid, stir well, and cover. Allow to sit for about 15-20 minutes until the texture changes to a soft gelatin. Store in refrigerator for up to one week. Add to smoothies and soups to boost nutrient value and create a thicker, more satisfying consistency.
* *Chia Pudding*: To make a dessert variation, mix ¬º cup of seeds with one cup of liquid such as milk (almond, soy, or dairy all work) or 100% fruit juice. Allow to sit for at least 15 minutes refrigerated. Add nuts, chopped fresh fruit, or cinnamon if desired.
* *Chia Sprouts*: Place chia seeds in a single layer (use only about a teaspoon to allow enough space to grow) in a terracotta saucer or un-glazed clay dish. Spray the seeds with water several times and cover with plastic wrap or a clear glass dish. Put in a sunny spot. Spray morning and evening until green sprouts appear, about 3-7 days. Use these micro-greens to garnish salads and sandwiches. 
* *Egg Replacement*: This may be used to replace whole eggs in baking. For 1 whole egg, mix 1 tablespoon of whole chia seeds or 2 teaspoons ground chia seeds with 3 tablespoons water. Allow to sit for at least 5 minutes or until the mixture thickens to the consistency of a raw scrambled egg.",2020-03-01

I'm not really going full health-nut, but I'm trying to cook mainly with healthy fats and whole foods (believe me, this is a step up from from my historical eating habits). My spare time is a bit chaotic -- I struggle to find the time to reliably cook fresh meals. So I depend very heavily on making large batches on the odd weekend and freezing for the future. I have a couple very dependable recipes for chili and beef barley soup that freeze quite well, but the same two meals over and over gets preeeetty old. Does anyone have any recommendations for recipes that can be easily doubled and freeze well? I have the larger size Instant Pot that I use as a slowcooker for those two recipes, so I do have an Instant Pot.

Small aside, there are multiple recipes that I want to try out, but I'm not sure how well they would freeze. Obviously soups, stews, chili etc do a pretty good job of defrosting, but what about just a straight up salmon fillet with some vegetables? Has anyone tried freezing asparagus, brussel sprouts, peppers, green beans?

**Ingredients:**

1. 8 medium bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (2 1/4 pounds)
2. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3. Good olive oil
4. 2 cups halved and thinly sliced yellow onions (2 onions)
5. 2 tablespoons dry white wine
6. 8 ounces creme fraiche
7. 1 tablespoon good Dijon mustard
8. 1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard
9. 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

**Directions:**

1. Place  the chicken thighs on a cutting board, skin side up, and pat  them  dry  with paper towels. Sprinkle the chicken with 1 1/2 teaspoons  salt  and  3/4 teaspoon pepper. Turn them over and sprinkle them with one  more   teaspoon of salt.
2. Heat 1   tablespoon olive oil in a large [(11 to 12-inch) cast-iron](https://www.topcellent.com/best-cast-iron-griddle-for-gas-stove/)  skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, place the chicken in the  pan in one   layer, skin side down. Cook over medium heat for 15  minutes without   moving, until the skin is golden brown. (If the skin  gets too dark, turn   the heat to medium low.) Turn the chicken pieces  with tongs, add the onions to the pan, including under the chicken, and  cook over medium  heat for 15 minutes, stirring the onions occasionally,  until the thighs   are cooked to 155 to 160 degrees and the onions are  browned. Transfer the chicken (not the onions) to a plate and allow to  rest uncovered   while you make the sauce. If the onions aren't browned,  cook them for   another minute.
3. Add  the wine,   creme fraiche, Dijon mustard, whole-grain mustard, and 1  teaspoon salt   to the skillet and stir over medium heat for one minute.  Return the   chicken, skin side up, and the juices to the skillet,  sprinkle with   parsley, and serve hot.",2020-03-03

"Japanese stye curry with chicken katsu, konkatsu sauce, fukujinzuke pickled radish and miso soup","I just got back from Japan and tried my hand at some Japanese cooking. Really not handy in the kitchen, so kinda proud of what I made :) Recipes used in post.

[Japanese style curry with chicken katsu, tonkatsu sauce, fukujinzuke pickled radish and miso soup](https://preview.redd.it/bqehpml7uuk41.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a47030a8ed1bf23b10fa0c6f0d4e08bcf8c3f93a)

# Chicken Katsu

[https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/72068/chicken-katsu/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/72068/chicken-katsu/)

I forgot to pound the chicken breast. Made the frying time longer and the meat a bit too dry. Served on Japanese sushi rice.

# Tonkatsu sauce

[https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240706/tonkatsu-sauce/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240706/tonkatsu-sauce/)

Made the day before, stored a small portion in the fridge and froze the rest for later. Served at room temperature

# Japanese curry

Made using my Crockpot. Bought the spicy curry roux cubes in Japan :) the site says 8 portions, but added less water because I read somewhere this recipe will turn out too watery. Got 4 portions out of it. Froze two, hoping the vegetables will survive being frozen.

# Radisshu no Amazu-zuke

[https://dailycookingquest.com/radisshu-no-amazu-zuke-sweet-vinegared-radish-pickle.html](https://dailycookingquest.com/radisshu-no-amazu-zuke-sweet-vinegared-radish-pickle.html)

The radishes didn't turn as red as the recipe mentions. Perhaps should have dried the radishes some more? Currently have a more extensive fukujinzuke recipe sitting in my fridge, but have to wait a few more days for it to settle.

Help finding recipe?,"When my husband and I started dating, almost 10 years ago now, I made him a pineapple upside down cake cheesecake for his birthday. It‚Äôs the best cake and cheesecake ever and I can‚Äôt seem to find the recipe through google. Can someone help me?

The way I remember how it was made was really interesting, you make a cake batter and a cheesecake batter. You then line a springform pan with pineapple rings and cherries, and maybe some butter and brown sugar? You then pour the regular yellow cake batter over that. Then you slowly pour the cheesecake batter in the middle of that, so that the cheesecake batter sort of pushes the cake batter out to the sides so that it forms the crust. It wasn‚Äôt simply a layered cake or cheesecake with pineapples on the crust. Then you bake in the springform pan like a cheesecake for about an hour pretty much following similar baking directions.

Problem is that all the recipes are very meaty and more on the western flavours side. I'm trying to be more vegetarian and have fallen in love with korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Malaysian cuisine.

Gonna pair some tea with this Irish scone recipe,"Thinking about these scones for St. Paddy's Day. Maybe will pair it with some Irish Breakfast Tea or, heck, kick off the celebrations early with some Irish coffee cuz I'm a wild card.

## Irish Scone Recipe

**Ingredients:**

* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/2 cup butter, cold, cut in cubes
* 1 cup black currants
* 1/2 cup cold buttermilk
* 1 egg, large
* 2 tablespoons buttermilk, reserved

**Directions:**

Preheat oven to 425F.

Place flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into bowl of food processor. Pulse once or twice to combine. Add cold butter chunks and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Pour mixture into large mixing bowl.

Add black currants to flour and butter mixture and gently stir to combine.

In measuring cup, add buttermilk and egg and whisk together well.

Make a well in dry mixture, pour in wet mixture, and stir gently with a fork until dough forms and holds together.

Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead gently once or twice just to make sure dough holds together. Roll out about 1 inch thick.

Using floured cup or cookie cutter, cut out rounds and place 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush tops of scones with buttermilk and bake 12-15 minutes until risen and golden brown on top.

Serve warm or room temperature with clotted cream or mascarpone and your favorite jam.

Chili!,"Here's the chili recipe I've been working on for the last few years. All of these ingredients should be pretty easy to aquire. I also try to use high quality/organic spices, they're a lot better than the off brand stuff. 

Ingredients: 

2 Tablespoons:
Chili powder 

1 Tablespoon:
Olive oil,
Hot Mexican style chili powder,
Cumin

1 Teaspoon:
Garlic powder,
Onion powder,
Berber spice,
Salt,
Pepper 

1/2 Teaspoon:
Oregano,
Cayenne,
Cocoa powder,

1 packet of sazon Goya,
1 beef bullion cube,

Sriracha hot sauce,

2 lbs ground Chuck,
4 strips of bacon,

1 white onion,
1 green pepper,
2 jalapenos,
3 Serrano peppers,
2 cloves of garlic,
(All chopped, obviously. Remove seeds from peppers if you don't like it too hot.)

Beef broth 14.5 oz,
Light red kidney beans 15.5 oz,
Tomato sauce 15.5 oz,
Crushed tomatoes 14.5 oz,

12 oz beer (lager or Amber ale),

Corn chips,
pepper jack cheese,
Green onion,
Sour cream,

Steps: 

Fry all the vegetables (except garlic) in a skillet on medium heat with olive oil until soft. Add garlic during last minute of cooking. Set aside. 

Chop up bacon and fry in the same skillet. Set aside. 

Lightly brown hamburger in leftover bacon grease. (Here I like to season the meat lightly with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and sriracha. This is optional and not reflected in the amounts of ingredients given above.) Drain the meat and set aside. 

Prepare liquids. (I usually work on this step while frying vegetables and meats.) Pour broth and beer into a large pot over medium heat. When simmering, add beef bullion cube and all the spices except the garlic and cumin. Mix and let simmer for 1 minute. 

Add tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, cooked vegetables and meat. Rinse kidney beans and add to pot. Stir and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour, uncovered, stirring occasionally. 

Add garlic powder and cumin. Simmer for another 1-2 hours until desired consistency, stirring occasionally. 

Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, corn chips, and chopped green onions. 

That's it! Sometimes I'll cut back to one pound of beef and sear some Chuck steak cubes and put in it instead. You can substitute different kinds of peppers as well. Anaheim peppers work really good in place of Serrano for a milder chili. Red beans (or no beans) is also good.",2020-03-09

Request: Jalapeno Popper Recipe,"Ok... at some point I had the nack for this recipe but my last few batches have been general failures. I can't figure out what the right cheese mix/temperature/time is to make jalapeno poppers. 

My basic technique is to cut the peppers in half, scoop out seeds/whites, stuff with 50-50 mix of cream cheese + grated cheddar/jack/mozzarella (what is available). Sometimes I add a piece of cooked bacon on the top. Place on foil lined cookie sheet and bake for some time at some temperature (that is where things seem to go wrong).

Issues: 

1. The cheese melts all over the sheet.  If I try to stop this then I hit issue #2.
2. The peppers are under cooked, still crunchy - I like the taste of them more cooked, not still half raw and watery. Maybe I should pre-cook/steam them?

What am I doing wrong? What is the magic time and temperature combination? Maybe the right cheese mix? I am eating keto and these are a great recipe for me.",2020-03-12

Homemade Golden Grahams!,"2 cups coarse whole wheat flour

1/2 to 1 cup of brown sugar(I use coconut sugar)

1 tsp cinnamon (or a little more)

1 tsp baking powder

3/4 tsp salt

7 tbsp butter

3 tbsp milk

1/3 cup honey

2 tsp vanilla\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Directions:

Whisk dry ingredients, add butter and milk and mix until it makes crumbs.

Mix wet ingredients, add wet to dry ingredients and mix together.

Roll into a ball and wrap with plastic wrap, ziplock bag or sealed container.

Chill dough and a rolling pin(marble works best) in fridge for 30 mins.

Preheat  oven to 350F.  Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 1/4"" thick  (thinner for crispier) and transfer to parchment paper.

Score with pizza cutter or pastry cutter and bake 11-15 minutes depending on thickness and desired crisp.

They will crisp a little more as they cool.  Enjoy!

Andy Ricker's recipe for Ba Mii Tom Yam Muu Heng,"Not sure if someone can clarify this....

&#x200B;

In Andy Ricker's recipe for Ba Mii Tom Yam Muu Heng ( Dry hot and sour pork soup) there is a part where it asks you to combine peanuts, fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, radish, oil, chili powder, noodles, pork balls, ground pork, bean sprouts, and long beans.

&#x200B;

Then put this mixture into a noodle basket and put the basket in boiling water for a while.

&#x200B;

What I don't understand is that the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, oil chili powder dissipates into the water and you loose that flavour. I would understand if the water was flavoured with this (like a broth), but the ratio's aren't mentioned because it doesn't specify the size of pot, and of course the more yo do in the pot the stronger the brother would get. I feel like I'm missing a critical step/not reading the instructions correctly. (Page 208 and 209 of the book).",2020-03-15

I'm trying to think of some recipes to make during quarantine. The only issue: most ""picky eater"" recipes online contain tomatoes and chicken!!

If you could suggest any yummy recipes without tomatoes or chicken, I would be happy to hear recommendations. I eat foods including: red meat, shrimp, bacon, ham, bread (any), cheese (any), pasta, rice, eggs, potatoes, peas, carrots, green beans, spinach, cucumber, fruits (any).

I don't do well with spicy foods, but sour/sweet/savory are all good. I have trouble eating foods like soup & stew (where there are chunks floating around), so I prefer solid foods and noodles. I love fruit! And I love rice dishes! I'm also willing to try new things, and to hear any advice on starting new foods (I am trying to make myself like mushrooms right now, for example). The only things I will not eat are tomatoes (anything made with tomatoes including pasta sauce, ketchup, etc.) and chicken.

All you need is some cookie dough of choice and something decent to dip into. My immediate thought was Chocolate Chip cookies and ice cream, but try whatever combinations you want!

2) Bake cookies 25-50% longer than reccomended time, or until a moderate brown and crunchy, but edible.

3) Dip into dessert dip of choice!

Recipe help required for a pregnant wife with biscuit (cookie) cravings,"My wife is 4 months pregnant and craving biscuits (or cookies, we are from the UK) like a mad (wo)man.

I went to the shop earlier and couldn't buy biscuits or any of the normal ingredients to make them.

I could buy ready-made porridge pots (the ones you add water to and stir, they have extra ingredients in like milk powder and sugar), but not rolled oats.  I have a little flower at home, honey, sugar and 2 eggs, butter and some oat and regular milk but couldn't buy anything any of these things at the supermarket to replenish.

Has anyone tried making sweet treats from the limited ingredients I have to hand or have enough experience to suggest a recipe?

It might save my life and/or marriage, but certainly my wife's sanity!

Alice Waters perfect boiled egg recipe,"In these trying times I would like to offer you a nice boiled egg. 85% of these eggs turn out perfectly if one follows the instructions. My wife prefers a more cooked yolk, so I boil for 10 minutes. Otherwise, if you crack the eggs really well after the minute in ice water, they will peel like a dream. 



1. To cook eggs in the shell, soft-boiled or hard-boiled, fill a pot with water deep enough to cover eggs by an inch or two, and bring to a boil.

2. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, and lower the eggs into the pot with a slotted spoon. For soft-boiled eggs with a runny yolk, simmer for 5 to 6 minutes. (If the eggs are very large or very small, adjust the timing by a minute more or a minute less.)

3. Remove the eggs, cool briefly in cold water, and serve in the shell with the top cut off, or crack them open and scoop the contents into a warm bowl. For hard-cooked eggs, with yolks just set but still moist at the center, simmer the eggs for 9 minutes. (For eggs with firmer yolks, simmer another minute or two.)

4. Remove and cool in cold water, then crack them all over and peel off the shells.",2020-03-18

I finally perfected my grandmother's pasta,"What youll need:
2-3 pounds of hamburger depending on how meaty you would like it
2 pounds of rotini noodles
1 packet of white country gravy
2 cans of cream of mushroom soup
1 pound of mild sharp cheddar
About a quarter bag of frozen sweet peas
And half a jar of your favorite Alfredo sauce

So I tried getting the timing of everything down and have it efficient.

Turn on your oven to 400 degrees.

Prepare your meal, it's always helpful to have everything you need out and planned out. (Get out your pots, get your ingredients ready etc)

If your hamburger is frozen get it started on defrosting- mine was and needed to defrost for 18 minutes. If you are defrosting, heat up your water now so everything is ready about the same time. If it's not defrosting, start your hamburger when there's about 8 minutes left on your noodles.

I cooked my noodles for about 13 minutes and loved how they turned out, but to each their own. I also out my peas in with my noodles when there was about 6 minutes left.

When the noodles are done drain them in the sink. I just set my pot down right on the edge of the sink, shake the extra liquid out and transfer the noodles back into the pot.

Now add your cream of mushroom, half the bottle of Alfredo, and the packet of country gravy and mix it really well. No one would want a dusty bite of gravy mix!

I then added my hamburger and mixed it up.

Pour your pasta into a baking dish and smooth it out and press it down if it's over flowing a little

Add your pound of cheese to the top and spread it out evenly 

Put the dish into the oven uncovered for about 15-20 minutes

If you're feeling spunky while it's baking is a good time to wash up your pans and clean up your mess so you don't have as much to do once you have a full comfy belly.

After it's done, the best way to serve it up is to use a spatula and try and keep your slice lasagna-like

Other than baking and topping the product with those, I'm not too sure of any other uses?",2020-03-23

Foolproof Fudge (two flavor options),"I have a bit of a secret. I can't make fudge. At least, not the tricky types. I found this recipe about a year ago and it has never failed me. I thought I would share it with you guys.

**Ingredients**

1 container of store- bought vanilla frosting (about a cup and a half)

2 tablespoons of peanut butter

Note- If you want chocolate fudge instead, add 3/4 of a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, instead of peanut butter.

1- Melt down the frosting so that it is about the consistency of heavy cream, about 1 minute 30 seconds in a microwave. If that isn't long enough, add another 30 seconds.

2- Mix the melted frosting so that all the non-melted bits at the bottom are incorporated. Add in your peanut butter, or cocoa powder. and mix vigorously. Pour into a brownie pan and drop onto the countertop to set the batter.

3- Put the pan into the fridge for about an hour at a time. Keep checking the pan after every hour to see if it is the right consistency. Once you feel it is done, cut into squares and serve.",2020-03-26

How should I prepare it, so that I have dinner for the next two days. I am a college student, so my budget is not the biggest. Currently I am thinking salmon lasagna. When would I add the salmon here? Do I bake it in the oven, shred it and add it to the white sauce? I saw another recipe where the filet was just placed on top.

Italian Green nettles Ravioli! (Vegetarian)," Have you ever homemade Italian green Ravioli? I just tried. It's not easy but the result is astonishing! Ravioli was a lot of work ( or I'm slow). Also, the temptation to make the Italian colours in such a moment of suffering for my country was too big. I added some homemade tomato sauce and Mozzarella!

So,

WHAT'S IN THERE?

4h

FOR THE PASTA:

100g of Nettles

400g of Flour

2 eggs.

FOR THE FILLING:

1 BIG Onion

2 Big eggplants

Olive oil

Salt.

FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE:

4 Tomatoes

100 g of tomato sauce

A bit of salt

A bit of sugar.

FOR THE THE RAVIOLI IN THE PAN:

30 Sage leaves

100g of butter

LITTLE FUNNY FOOD FACT:

Did you know that Ravioli is a typical Italian dish? There is an infinite variety, they change in every region of Italy for the shape, the fill and the name! You could spend half of your life eating different kinds of them.

Well Done, by reading until here you just enhanced your Culture!

Hoping for a tomato chunk-less lasagna recipe,"I realize it may seem like a bizarre request. I've just always had some texture issues with some specific foods, mushy/non-uniform tomatoes being one of them.

Lately I find myself craving some lasagna, but I don't want it to go to waste because I didn't feel like digging out tomato lumps I find.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to substitutes, or an actual recipe? (It's not the taste of the tomatoes, I'll drink tomato juice, and I love avocados, for example, despite their mushiness.) Would using an immersion blender with recipes that call for crushed tomatoes ""ruin"" it  too much?

Thanks for any pointers!

"Tzatziki and Ayran recipes - functional version, with extra caveats for the culinarily under-experienced","TZATZIKI recipe - functional/nutritional explanation

More details and idiot-proofing the further down you read, so if you know what you're doing in the kitchen feel free to skim as you get further down.

&#x200B;

So what most people know as tzatziki sauce is actually supposed to be a... salad I guess you could call it. It's yogurt and cucmbers mixed together and spiced that you eat straight/with bread as a meal or as a significant portion of a meal (yes, yogurt is a meal, it has plenty of protein. Ditto cheese. I've had people mock my meals like this, but this is a common thing with Near-Eastern style food).

&#x200B;

The dish spans continents and has plenty of similar names. In my parents' Farsi it's jajeek, in Armenian it may be known as yalanchi, in Arabic it's jalajeek, to Greeks it's tzatziki. Even India has it but known as Raita but a bit more different than the other recipes. 

&#x200B;

I don't provide measurements because I don't think it's necessary here or for most of practical cooking. I trust the reader won't spastically add a solid handful of salt or 2 cups of oil to one tub of yogurt. Outside of that, everything is to taste. Only thing I'd say is 2 to 4 cloves of garlic for your typical 32 ounce tub of yogurt is already pretty garlicky... I believe, I haven't made this in a while. The garlic flavor will be stronger the next day as the yogurt absorbs the flavor of the garlic.

&#x200B;

So the tl;dr version for people who are very versed in cooking is that it's any kind of unflavored yogurt seasoned with garlic and dried mint or dried oregano and a bit of extra salt. Use only the dried herb. Crush/mince the garlic with the salt and let it sit for a bit to draw out and mellow the flavor; I've read some people soak the garlic in lemon juice to do this, but I can't vouch for that method. I feel like using mainly oregano as the herb could go well with a small pinch of mint, but if you're using mainly mint I wouldn't use oregano, I don't think those flavors mix well in large amounts. Other commonly included ingredients are olive oil, lemon juice, and white pepper. It will last a lot longer if you keep it as a yogurt mix and scoop out some and mix with cucumbers separately when you want to have the salad. Adding a little olive oil if you want it won't make the yogurt break/separate. Nor should lemon juice, even with 2% yogurt, as long as you don't add too much. Lemon might make it more grainy if you use 1.5% non-greek but it's not the end of the world (there's a note below if you don't know what I'm talking about).

&#x200B;

\-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

&#x200B;

To add a little more analysis for people who need it:

Feel free to use whatever kind of yogurt you like for nutritional purposes, but the most traditional and best flavor and texture for this use is just plain whole milk yogurt, non-greek style. Greek yogurt is fine if you want that extra protein, but it doesn't mix as well and doesn't carry the flavor as well and isn't as savory as regular yogurt (I think the comparatively extra water of regular yogurt helps carry the umami/salt flavor better). 2% yogurt is also OK to cut back calories, but obviously it won't taste as good. Using olive oil (NOT extra virgin, see below) if you're using 2% yogurt may be a good idea to replace some of the fat that would otherwise be there and bring in more flavor. Nutritionally this would be healthier according to some people's opinions because you'd be taking some of the butterfat you'd be having with whole milk and replacing it with olive oil fat, which is heart healthier. But remember, fat is fat and OVEDRdoing it has the same fattening and heart-health effects regardless of the kind of fat.

You shouldn't be using extra virgin olive oil for this because it's too strong and bitter. In general I find extra virgin olive oil isn't really suitable for most cooking for this same reason, only for bread dipping and maybe some salad dressings. 

You shouldn't be using fat-free yogurt for this because there isn't sufficient flavor. In fact, you shouldn't be using fat-free yogurt for anything you're going to eat because the tastiness/healthiness ratio is just way too low to justify it. 1.5% yogurt saves on enough calories while still tasting decent.

&#x200B;

The stuff below gets into idiot-proofing. Each paragraph is one topic, so if you know about the caveat within the first sentence, you can skip the paragraph:

&#x200B;

The mention above about the yogurt becoming grainy if you add lemon juice, if you do not understand, is that lemon juice curdles dairy products. Fats, starches, and proteins prevent this process from occuring, so a higher-fat yogurt will be less likely to curdle. If the yogurt does curdle a bit which may happen with 1.5%

&#x200B;

When I say crush/mince the garlic with salt, I mean that the resultant paste/particles should be mixed with salt. I usually just add a pinch into the garlic-crusher I use so the garlic comes out already mixed with salt. The salt will draw out the moisture from the garlic, which carries a lot of flavor, but will also help mellow it out by exposing it to the air (again, let it sit for a bit, however long is practical. Even 5 minutes will do. If you don't want to wait don't, just do this step first and let it sit for as long as it takes you to do everything else). If you don't have a garlic-crusher, I recommend investing in a good one, since adding garlic and lots of it is essential to good cooking and something you'll be doing often.

&#x200B;

And while I'm still adding stuff to make this recipe idiot-proof, let me mention that your cucumbers should be peeled and chopped medium to small. No exact size, just how you like it.

&#x200B;

Yogurt by itself lasts a damn long time in the fridge, like six weeks, and the added salt here may make it last longer.

&#x200B;

If you don't understand what I'm referring to when I keep mentioning 2% or 1.5% yogurt, it's referring to the fat content. They make low-fat yogurts by removing some of the fat, which cuts backs on calories and makes the yogurt healthier generally speaking. The yogurt that is not in any way low fat may be marked as ""whole milk"" yogurt. 2%, 1.5%, and 1% yogurts have less and less fat respectively. 0% yogurt may be marked as ""fat-free"" yogurt or ""skim-milk"" yogurt.

&#x200B;

White pepper is like black pepper, but without that outer black coating. It's the sharp bite of pepper, but none of the aroma, a much simpler, lighter flavor but still a lot of bite. You should buy it pre-ground in the spice aisle (which is usually in the baking aisle). One good thing about it is it never relly gets old, since it's all bite and no aroma, there's no aroma to slowly volatilize off and it will always have that bite.

&#x200B;

And of course, you can use it as a sauce for gyros. Obviously cut the cucumbers very small in that case.

&#x200B;

And one last ancillary note:

There are people who add soaked raisins and walnuts in there, but I really don't like it that way. This dish should be all savory no sweet, though the texture of the nuts some people may like (just soak raw dried walnuts in lightly salted water overnight. This is also a traditional Persian way of eating walnuts in general).

DOOGH / TAHN / AYRAN recipe - YOGURT DRINK recipe - functional explanation

&#x200B;

This is a yogurt-based drink that goes by a lot of different names in a lot of different countries, again all in the Near-East. You can even buy it pre-made and bottled at middle eastern shops, though it's not nearly as good as home made and it's an easy recipe. And yes, they bottle yogurt-based sodas, weird, I know. The white yogurt part eventually settles to the bottom and you have to mix it up a lot of the time right before you consume it.

&#x200B;

Basically you mix regular, unflavored, whole-milk yogurt into water with some salt, and stir it up to mix it. Usually you add some dried mint. It should be noticeably salty, but not crazy salty like let's say a V8. Enough to bring out a strong salty savory flavor. It should be fully liquid and pourable, obviously thicker than water, but still full-on beverage-level pourability. Can put ice in the glass to keep cold, is fine.

&#x200B;

You might be able to get away with 2% yogurt, but I wouldn't go any lower than that in fat content, you need them fat for flavor and already this is a drink that's thinned out with water. And don't use Greek yogurt as it's like stepping backward to step forward - Greek yogurt is just yogurt with a lot of the water removed, when in this recipe you're adding water anyway. Maybe in theory you could make more of the drink with one tub of Greek yogurt since it's more concentrated and you could just add more water? But I wouldn't try it, Greek yogurt tastes a bit different.",2020-04-01

Lost Jerk Pepper Topping,"Hey guys!

I have been searching for months online for this recipe I made in July of 2019. I was looking up stuff for meal prep and I came across a Jerk Chicken recipe with a Roasted Pepper topping. For all that is holy I CANNOT find the recipe again and didn't print it off again to recreate. I am hoping you all might be able to assist.

The recipe contains the following (from memory): Red peppers (fire roasted), jalapenos, habaneros, bay leaves, sugar, brown sugar, chili flakes. 

I know it is incredible vague. The sauce looks thick and deep red. Looks *nowhere* close to that of a red pepper jelly you would put on a log of brie during Thanksgiving that you can buy on the shelf at your local Sprouts. 

The website/blog I found it on had a recipe for Jerk chicken as well as a solid coconut rice recipe and there was a link for the Hot Red pepper topping.  If you can help me I will 100% buy you whatever drink you want at Starbucks!!

TIA!

Chicken Curry With Coconut Milk,"**Ingredients**

* 2 tbsp olive oil

* 2 tbsp red curry paste

* 1 large sweet onion, thinly sliced

* 1 large carrot, shredded

* 1 tbsp fresh ginger or ginger paste

* 1 1/2 lbs chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces (I used drumsticks and it still worked well)

* 1-14.5 oz can stewed tomatoes

* 1 oz can full-fat coconut milk

* 2 tbsp brown sugar

*  3 cloves garlic, crushed

* 2 tbsp tomato paste

&nbsp;

**Directions**

1\.  In a large skillet over medium heat whisk together olive oil and curry paste. Add onions and cook until they begin to soften stirring frequently. Add the carrots, ginger and chicken and cook until the chicken is almost cooked through.

2\.  Reduce the heat to simmer. Add the stewed tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the coconut milk, brown sugar, crushed garlic and tomato paste. Simmer for 10-15 minutes to thicken the sauce.

3\.  Serve over rice or noodles.

**Note:**  As mentioned above, I used fresh chicken drumsticks, so I browned them before I added the liquids, and extended the total time in the braise to ~60 minutes (30 min simmer, turn, 30 min more).

Filipino food advice- chicken adobo,"Hi all! 

When I was a kid, I had friends who had a Chinese/Filipino mother and she made the BEST chicken adobo ever- I never even knew what it was called until I saw it on tv the other week. Now I *need* it. From what I remember, it took her most of the day to make it, or at least she stewed it for most of the day. All of the recipes I see put an emphasis on marinating the chicken for a few hours, and then cooking it for about a half an hour. 

What are your recommendations for cook/marinate time? I‚Äôm tempted to just try it the way I remember her doing it, but I don‚Äôt want to waste any food trying to recreate something that I remembered wrong. Thanks!",2020-04-03

Anchovy fillet substitute,"So I missed my chance at the store yesterday (while risking COVID-19) to pick up a can of anchovy fillets, and a recipe I want to make calls for them. What can I use instead?  I have Kalamata olives as I've seen suggested elsewhere but I don't know the ratio of olive:fish that would satisfy the substitution. Can anyone help? I do not want to go to the store again today just for fillets. 

Also on hand:

Worcestershire sauce

oyster sauce

TL;DR--what is the ratio for various substitutes to 1 anchovy fillet?",2020-04-03
My mother is hoarding food and there's a cabbage aging in the fridge. What can I do with it?,"I'm an adult living in a multi-generational household looking for a good use of a whole head of cabbage. My go-tos with it are stir-fry, steaming or thinly grated salads/coleslaw, but I'd like to do something more exciting with it.

We already have more than 64 oz. of sauerkraut in cans and a tub of kimchi, which is why this is such a frustrating opportunity.",2020-04-03
Vegetable Flavour Cubes,"I make these and keep them in the freezer. They are great when defrosted and scattered in cheese quesadilla or grilled cheese sandwiches. Mix defrosted cubes into scrambled eggs. Add a few frozen cubes to your favorite pasta sauce or soup.

Makes 2 dozen cubes

1 medium carrot finely grated

1 small zucchini finely grated

1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil

8 cremini or 2 portobello mushrooms, cleaned and finely chopped

1 cup baby spinach leaves cut into chiffonade

3 minced garlic cloves

3 tablespoons tomato paste

salt and fresh grated pepper

&#x200B;

1. Put the carrots and zucchini on paper towels and press gently to remove excess liquid.
2. Heat the oil in a large nonstick saute pan over high heat, add the mushrooms and cook until lightly golden brown about 8 minutes. Add carrots and zucchini and cook until soft, stirring occasionally, another 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes while stirring constantly to remove raw taste. Add minced garlic and cook about 1 minute. Stir in the spinach and cook until just wilted. Season well with salt and pepper to taste. Spread on a large baking sheet and let cool completely.
3. Fill each cube, in an ice cube tray, with mixture. Press down to firmly pack each cube. Freeze uncovered until firm. Remove and transfer cubes to freezer bag. Date and label bag.

Note: You can double the recipe but you will need to freeze in batches.",2020-04-04

Best Crock Pot Pork Green Chili,"Hey all! Here's my green chili recipe to keep you company during the plague! Nothing in this recipe is particularly exact, and it's made a little differently each time. As long as a few key components (Which shall be noted) remain the same, you'll have good results. I make this in a six quart crock pot, so if yours is significantly larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust accordingly.


**Ingredients:**


 * 1 1/2 pound pork, cut into 1 inch cubes. Butt is good -- you need some nice connective tissue for this (Chicken thighs would also work pretty well.) 
 * 3/4 pound Bacon, cut into 1 inch strips. This is essential, you need that smoky flavor (If you can't eat pork and are using chicken thighs as noted above, try a smoked turkey leg, but I never have.)
 * 2 pounds of tomatillos, quartered. You need some tomatillos in this, total amount can vary.
 * 1 16 oz can of diced tomatoes. I know this is technically a green chili, but my extensive research indicates that some amount of tomatoes is necessary.
 * 3 - 4 Jalepino peppers roasted, peeled and diced. Total amount of jalepinos to taste. Could be zero. Roast them under a broiler or on a burner of some sort and then put them in a bag for easy peeling. Strongly suggest you wear gloves when peeling peppers.
 * 4-5 Anaheim peppers (The long light green ones), roasted, peeled and diced. Again, this is a matter of taste, you could have fewer, you could have more. WAY MORE. *ahem*. But this is a good starting point.
 * 2 limes, which I will discuss later.
 * Garlic. I'm not going to say exactly how much. Depends on how you feel about garlic. Personally I'd start with 4-5 cloves, smashed, and see how it goes.
 * 1/2 to 1 onion depending on how you feel about onion. Peeled and coarsely chopped. Or diced, if you prefer.
 * 1 tablespoon freshly ground cumin. Approximately. If that doesn't sound or smell like enough cumin to you, add more. If it sounds like too much, add less.
 * Salt and pepper to taste.
 * Water or pork stock (or chicken stock), to cover.


**Directions:**


Chuck everything but the limes in the crock pot, add stock just to cover. Cut one of the limes in half and squeeze the juice from both halves into the crock pot when you start cooking. Cook on high for 4 hours.  At the end of 4 hours, taste the chili and add the juice of the other lime if it's not tangy enough. If the chili isn't thick enough for you, you can make a slurry of corn starch or flour and use that to thicken it a bit. This isn't really designed as a super-thick chili, but I usually like it a little thicker than it comes out on its own.


You can brown the meat and sweat the veggies if you want to, but I honestly haven't found it to make all that much of a difference for this chili.


**Serving Suggestions:**


 * On and in any burrito, especially a breakfast burito
 * In a bowl on its own, or with rice.
 * Add 1:1 chili and shredded cheese to a bowl and curl up with a nice bag of corn chips.
 * Over tamales is good",2020-04-04

Arugula salad with avocado dressing,"I would love some feedback on this recipe, and see if anyone else thinks it would be good. It was very quick to make, and me and my girlfriend loved it. It's probably the first recipe I have made that is worth writing down. The only thing we didn't like was that it had a lot of bitter flavors, and needed something sweet. I think I might replace the bell pepper with an orange or something else sweeter to cut down on the spice, since arugula is already pretty peppery. 

**Ingredients**

* Arugula leaves
2. 1x avocado
3. 1x lemon
4. 1x radish
5. 1x sweet bell pepper
5. Olive oil
6. 1x can sardines
7. Black pepper

**Directions**

1. Combine avocado, 5 tbsp olive oil, the juice from one lemon, and black pepper in a blender. Liquify until smooth and uniform. Add olive oil to achieve desired texture.
2. Thinly slice the radish, so slices are translucent
3. Cut and seed the bell pepper.
4. Break down sardines into bite-sized chunks.
4. Combine arugula, radishes, bell pepper, and sardines in a bowl. Drizzle with avocado dressing and serve.",2020-04-06

"Looking for grilled or similar Asparagus recipe (long time lurker, first post)","Hello!  

I'm a lover of all things food and a bit of a lurker on this sub.  This is my first post, I usually do ok on my own with most things cooking.I have a few recipes, I would love to share and will, once I get them dialed in.  Like the title stars, I'm looking for a delicious asparagus recipe...  please assist if you please....  thank you

EDIT:  thank you for all the üí° ideas

Here's the RECIPE 

3/4 cups -drizzled  olive oil   
1/2 Tsp  of Kosher Salt 
1/8  Tsp of pepper - I like the trio of  white,  black and  pink- in a grinder   To season your taste.
My secret was  Garlic and Parmesan cheese seasoning!  Enjoy! 

I used a toss away  pan.. and Tin foil

Hear grill to at least 450   
Toss every 2-3 minutes   For a total of 10 minutes 
Let stand for a few before serving!!",2020-04-08

"Brunch ideas that aren't eggs, waffles, or pancakes?","My girlfriend wants to do Easter Brunch this year, and I'm trying to come up with a brunch menu for us. The problem is that she HATES eggs, won't come near anything that looks like them. Also, I'm getting an italian easter sweet bread because my Italian grandparents would come back from the dead just to slap me if I didn't, and I don't want the entire menu to be sweet carbs. I'm struggling to think of a festive brunch menu that doesn't include eggs and covers all the nutrition bases. It doesn't need to be super healthy, but I'd like to have more on the table than bread and sugar haha.

Here's what I'm definitely doing so far:

* Various pastel-colored mimosas (I'm thinking OJ and a dry champagne and grapefruit juice with a sparkling moscato, but if you have any other pastel-colored ideas I'd love to hear them)
* coffee
* Italian easter egg sweet bread
* fruit salad

Here are my ideas:

* Mini croque-monsieur (it's got meat and doesn't have eggs, which is what I'm looking for, but I'm not sure it's the perfect menu item) OR ham and cheese spinach puffs
* Charcuterie board (is this weird for brunch?)
* just a plate of breakfast sausage/bacon (this doesn't feel \~festive holiday\~ enough, but I don't know how else to put protein and meat on the table)

What are your favorite brunch foods? What do you think about my ideas, or what would you add instead? Any help is appreciated!",2020-04-09

I recently made a batch of Churros using all purpose flour and they came out pretty well.

Scalion Pancake Quandry,"Well, this looks delightful. But you know, once you watch one video about something on YouTube, you get recommended others. Which means that I've seen now several videos on the subject, and there seems to be some disconnect about how to achieve the desired flakiness. This reminds me of the variable advice I came across once upon a time to get maximum puffing from popovers - different cooks swore by different techniques, but they all seemed to be satisfied with their own results. 

Souped Up Recipes says that the use of flour oil is what makes it so flaky and crispy:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EgspSFnORo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EgspSFnORo)

Some recipes don't seem to require this flour oil, so obviously those cooks don't think this is the essential technique. Chinese Cooking Demystified says that the flour oil actually acts as a roux and serves to bind layers together, which makes sense. They would remain layers, but I'm guessing this roux would draw moisture from above and below while being cooked and form a different kind of layer between. 

Strictly Dumpling actually talks mostly about fluffiness, but he talks about layers when he demonstrates how fluffy the pancake comes out, so this appears to be what everyone else is calling flakiness. He holds that massaging the dough is what causes this effect, but he keeps saying that massaging the dough relaxes it, which as far as I understand it actually does the opposite.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipCpZO\_WgU&t=901s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipCpZO_WgU&t=901s)

Angel Wong's Kitchen recommends scrunching the pancake toward the end of cooking to fluff it up. My guess is that the technique is to have the layers already cooked, but still separable, and when you force them apart and then continue cooking they crisp up better apart. Seems plausible. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iew9c7wDfgM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iew9c7wDfgM)

YuCanCook recommends covering the pan while the pancake cooks because the water in the pancake will expand and thus cause flakiness. Seems to me like this will happen anyway -- that's the theory behind hydrating your dough. But does having the lid on intensify this effect?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPyQWm2rPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPyQWm2rPc)

Seems to me like the main thing that creates flaky layers is the oil between layers of dough that have then been squeezed together using the technique of rolling, coiling and flattening, which the heart of the recipe and technique for every version I've seen. I'll bet if I do all that, I'll be pleased with the result. Techniques above and beyond that are possibly just part of a human desire to feel like you have more control than you do. 

I think the way I'll try it, when I have some flour again, use the half-hour resting rather than overnight, roll out on a floured surface rather than a messier oiled surface, use just oil on some pancakes and flour oil on others to see if I can detect a difference and form a preference. I'll want to make multiple batches experimenting with the flour ratio, between Souped Up Recipe's 3:2 and Chinese Cooking Demystified's 5:3. Also, I may want to see if the difference between using warm or hot water matters much. And I'll simply be biased toward developing my own version using my Kitchen Aid to do the mixing. Chinese Cooking Demystified says you can use speed 1 on the mixer, and everybody else recommends doing it by hand.",2020-04-10

Gordon Ramsay's English Hash Browns,"Gordon Ramsay has to be my all time favorite chef. His erratic yelling is just his way of being passionate of something he loves.

**Some Facts:**¬†The idea of hash browns can be found as early as 1888, in New York City; where it was served in the finest hotels. Today, it may seem like something you can only find in diners or fast food restaurants, but it's quite simple and a very filling breakfast dish.

**Ingredients:**¬†Idaho Potatoes (you can use any type of potatoes you like), Spanish Onions, Olive Oil, Butter, Salt, Pepper (I am not using bacon or eggs because I am a vegetarian¬†)

Quantity:

2 Large Potatoes

1 Medium sized Spanish Onion

4 Tablespoons of Olive Oil

1.5 Tablespoons of butter 

Salt and Pepper to taste

I do not count calories or serving sizes. I eat because it enjoy it and I cook because I love it. Total Time to prep and cook: 30 - 50 Minutes.

**Directions:**

**1.**¬†Peel the top layer of your potatoes completely.

**2.**¬†Remove the first layer of skin on your onions.

**3.**¬†Using a large cheese grater start grating the potatoes into a plate or colander; I recommend a colander because of the holes on the bottom - it will be easy to remove the excess liquid from the potatoes.

**4.**¬†After you grated all of the potatoes, you need to press and squeeze them to remove the liquid; this might take a few minutes to do, but the more liquid that comes out - the crisper your Hash Browns will become.

**5.**¬†Now you can use the grater to grate the onions. After you grated your onion completely - mix the mixture of potatoes and onions really well. You want to have potatoes and onions on each bite.

**6.** Add the olive oil into your pan - make sure its on medium heat.

**7.** Add¬†your hash brown mixture into the pan and use a spatula to push down the sides of the hash brown.

**8.**¬†After about 10 - 15 minutes your has brown should be ready to flip; make sure you are able to remove the hash brown off the pan easily or else it will stick to the pan causing tears and rips.

**9.**¬†Once you have flipped the hash brown you are going to cut your butter into small flakes and spread it around the sides, this will caramelize the onions and add some fat to your hash brown. The goal is to get both sides of the hash brown golden brown.

**10.**¬†After another 10 - 15 minutes you should be ready to remove your hash brown onto a serving plate.

You are now ready to serve your Hash Browns. Buon Appetito

DIY Nestle Chocapic/Nestle Koko Krunch/Kellogg's Chocos Cereal,"
						Chocapic Cereal
						
						Ingredients:
						Petals:
						
						5/8th cup Wholegrain Wheat Flour
						2 1/2 tablespoons Cornstarch
						3 teaspoons Nestl√© Toll House Baking Cocoa
						1/4 Baking Soda
						3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon Water
						1 tablespoon Sugar
						1/2 tablespoon oil
						1/4 teaspoon salt
						
						Coating:
						
						4 teaspoons Sugar
						1/2 tablespoon Nestl√© Toll House Baking Cocoa
						1/4 teaspoon Vanilla
						2 tablespoons Boiling Water
						¬†
						

Instructions

						
Chocolate petals
						

						Pre-heat the oven to 320 degrees fahrenheit.

						Measure the dry ingredients and sieve into a mixing bowl.

						In a mixing cup, measure the wet ingredients and stir until all solids are dissolved.

						Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix, knead slightly to form a homogenous dough (do not over-mix as this will lead to less rise during baking and hard texture in finished product).

						Divide the dough into two balls, wrap in cling film and leave to rest in a fridge for 20 minutes (this allows the dough to relax and reduce shrinkage during rolling).

						Take the first dough ball out of the fridge, flatten into a disk and dust both sides with a little corn starch.

						Roll out the disk into a circle almost 8 inches in diameter (approximately 1/16th inchs thick), cut out as many petal shapes as possible using the cutter provide.

						Arrange cut petals around the edge of a baking tray to give a curved shape after baking.

						Repeat the same process for the second dough ball.

						Bake at 320 degrees fahrenheit for 10 minutes in a fan oven.

						Allow to cool after baking.

						Weigh 1 3/4 ounces of the baked chocolate petals, put aside for coating.

						
Chocolate Coating
						

						Mix sugar, cocoa and vanilla together and remove any lumps, add the boiling water and stir until solids are fully dissolved, use immediately (if slurry has cooled down too much, microwave for a few seconds without boiling).

						Place 1 3/4 ounces of the baked chocolate petals in a mixing bowl, drizzle 2 ¬Ω teaspoon of the hot slurry, stir continuously with a spoon until all petals are coated thoroughly (minimum 1 minute).

						Spread coated petals on a baking tray lined with a sheet of non-stick paper and bake at 212 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes.",2020-04-14

## Ham, Brie, and Apple Tea Sandwich

*serves 3 hungry people (or 6 not-so-hungry)*

**Ingredients:**

* 6 slices olive sourdough bread
* Butter
* 3 tablespoons onion jam
* 3 slices of ham
* 1 wheel Brie, sliced in 1/4-inch slices
* 1 apple, halved, cored, and thinly sliced

**Directions:**

Lay the sourdough bread slices on a clean cutting board and butter one side of each.

Spread 3 of the slices with 1 tablespoon each of onion jam.

Top each of those 3 slices with 1 slice of ham, enough slices of Brie to cover, and enough slices of apple to cover.

Top with remaining pieces of bread, butter side down. Press gently to ensure sandwich stays together.

Place on griddle or in sandwich press and toast until the cheese begins to melt and the bread begins to brown.

Remove to cutting board and cut each sandwich in half. Serve warm or at room temperature.

They are both really sad and nervous because of COV-19 ravashing italy so i thought that if i could make them something that reminds them of home it would take their mind off of the bad thoughts and focus them on the good ones. Could you please link me some dessert recipes from naples or surrounding cities i could make for them to remind them of home? Perferably not to difficult as im still learning. Thank you in advance! <3 <3 <3,2020-04-16

Chrissy Teigen/Ina Garten Baked Eggs,"So on Chrissy Teigen's Instagram story, about a week ago, she made this delicious looking egg dish in her broiler. I forgot about it until today... She made a similar dish with some adjustments. I googled around a bit and figured out that a week ago, she was making a recipe from Ina Garten. [This recipe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNNGnjUxDQY)

Today, she added some things like heirloom tomatoes to it. [And it looked like this.](https://imgur.com/acwL8HM) She also added arugula and the final product [looked like this](https://imgur.com/JnnTiRo). So I wrote down the recipe. 90% of it is Ina Garten's recipes, with the rest being Chrissy's adjustments. I wrote it down and figured I'd share! Enjoy!



Serves 4/Cut in half for 2 

**For the egg dish:**

¬Ω teaspoon minced garlic

¬Ω tsp minced thyme

¬Ω tsp minced rosemary

2 tbsp minced parsley 

2 tbsp grated parmesan cheese

12 eggs

¬º cup heavy cream

2 tbsp unsalted butter

Salt

Pepper

Heirloom tomatoes ¬º inch thick slices

Basil


**For the toast:**

Sourdough Bread

Salt

Crushed red pepper

Arugula



**This recipe makes 4 separate dishes OR you can put all the ingredients into one dish like a cast iron skillet,  or any other oven safe dish, and pull all ingredients into that for ‚Äúfamily style‚Äù.

* Preheat oven
* Slice the bread, place on a cookie sheet, brush with olive oil, sprinkle with some salt and crushed red pepper to taste, place in the oven. Let bread get nice and toasted

* Preheat broiler for 5 min

* Combine garlic, thyme, rosemary, parsley, and parmesan in a small bowl.
* CAREFULLY crack 3 eggs into 4 small bowls, mugs, or cups (you won‚Äôt be baking them in these) without breaking the yolks. (It is very important to have the eggs prepped like this)

* Place four individual gratin dishes on a baking sheet. Place ~1 tbsp of cream and ¬Ω tbsp butter in each dish and place under the broiler for about 3 minutes, until hot and bubbly (cream will get slightly burnt, this is good). Open the oven and quickly, but carefully, pour 3 eggs into each gratin dish and sprinkle evenly with herb mixture, then sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place back under the broiler for 5 to 6 minutes, until the whites of the eggs are almost cooked. About halfway through, put tomatoes directly on top of each egg and sprinkle with basil. (Rotate the baking sheet once if they are not cooking evenly.) The eggs will continue to cook after you take them out of the oven. Allow to set for 60 seconds and serve hot. Scoop individual eggs/tomatoes with a [large spoon onto toast.](https://imgur.com/13qTKQ0)

* Assemble bottom to top like this: toast, arugula, egg/tomato yumminess",2020-04-17

Recipes that could use not great quality stew meat,"During the panic over the corona outbreak I bought two frozen pieces of beef from the supermarket. They are both around one kilo, around 40 percent the price that good quality fresh meat would be. I believe the meat is from Argentina (obviously Argentina has good meat, this is not it). It definitely isn't the best quality, it's frozen boneless  beef shank and doesn't have much marbling it. I like beef shin in chinese red cooking/noodle soups but I'm used to doing that with much better quality and fresher meat. Right now I was planning to braise it for a long time with chicken stock, unsweetened pomegranate juice, cumin, cinnamon, til it was shreddable then make lahmacun with it, tacos maybe.

Salt (a pinch)

Sugar (to taste)

&#x200B;

Cooking process:

Add the Lemon Peel, Cinnamon Stick, Half the Margarine, Milk and Salt to a pan

Let it boil

Now that it's boiling add the Rice

Cook until Rice is soft inside and fully cooked at medium heat and stirring frequently so it doesn't stick to the pan

Adjust the sauce, you can add more milk if you see it's too sticky

Remove the Lemon Peel

Add the remain Margarine

Now, add some of the cooked rice to the Yolks and mix

Then add that mixture to the rice, little by little, stirring quickly so the Yolks don't boil

Cook for  2 min

Done

Serve with Cinnamon Powder on top!

(This recipe is very flexible in terms of the quantities you can use)

Enjoy!

And remember...

I'm looking to record down some family recipes but would ideally like to sprinkle the steps with images and video instead of the usual numbered list approach.

Taco Soup,"Here is a recipe that we shared around work. It is an easy dump recipe that uses mostly pantry ingredients. The cost to make a pot is around 20$ worth of groceries if you have to buy everything (not including the toppings).

2 pounds ground beef or turkey

1 can (4 ounces) chopped green chilies

1 large onion

1 package ranch dressing mix - I use Uncle Dan's - no msg

1 package taco seasoning mix

1 can (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained

1 can (16 ounces) kidney beans, rinsed and drained

1 cup of frozen corn

2 cans (15 ounces) stewed tomatoes

3-4 garlic cloves, minced

Brown meat and onions. Drain excess fat if needed. Mix in ranch & taco seasoning mix. Then add all of the additional ingredients. Simmer for at least 1 hour (better if you have 2) or place in slow cooker for the better part of the day. The longer it cooks, the better it is. Feeds 6 to 8 people.

Serve with Corn tortilla strips, sour cream, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and diced green onions.

NOTE: You need to use a large dutch oven to hold everything. ",2020-04-21

See's Candies Bordeaux," Ingredients

* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1/4 cup whipping cream
* 1 teaspoon instant coffee (I used a 0.11oz Starbucks Via pack)
* pinch salt
* 2 cups sifted powdered sugar
* 12 ounces dark chocolate
* 1 tablespoon butter

### Directions

* Using a heavy bottom saucepan, melt butter and brown sugar together over medium high heat and bring to boil. Allow to boil for about two minutes.
* Stir in cream, instant coffee, and salt and allow to come to a boil again for about 30 seconds while stirring constantly to avoid scorching. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Add sifted powdered sugar to mixture and stir in well until a consistent dough is formed. Chill until mixture holds shape similar to play dough, about 2 hours.
* Roll sugar dough into 2-inch balls and set on a wax paper lined sheet. Freeze for about 10 minutes for easier dipping.
* Melt chocolate and butter at 50% power in 1 minute increments in microwave, stirring after each minute, until melted.
* Dip candy balls into melted chocolate and allow to set on the wax paper. Either sprinkle with chocolate cake sprinkles or pipe a very thin stream of chocolate on top, if desired.
* Store in airtight container.

1 tbsp soft butter

1/2 cup tomato meat sauce - warm in microwave for 60 seconds

2 - 4 tbsp grated Parmesan

2 slices bread

2 slices mozzarella

2 slices fontina

Butter the bread slices on one side and press the Parmesan on the butter. Heat a non-stick pan to med. On non butter/cheese side - place 1 slice mozzarella, 1 slice fontina, warm sauce, other slice mozzarella and fontina. Top with second bread slice butter/cheese up. Cook till golden on one side, about 5 minutes, then flip (carefully) and cook another 5 minutes on other side. Wear bib to eat.

\- If you've used any app with recipes before: was there any feature that you felt was annoyingly missing? 

\- If you haven't used an app with recipes, what would make you consider getting one? 

\- If you cook at home and use a new recipe what's the typical  struggle you need to deal with usually? 

\- If you like looking for / testing new recipes: how do you find them? Are you looking for a specific dish, or a category, or maybe you're starting with an ingredient you've already got at home?

Recipe by clicking ingredients-can't find the webpage,"Hi r/recipes,

recently a well known recipe site (think NYT Cooking, Bon Appetite, Epicurious, etc) released a tool where you could click the ingredients you have, and it would show you recipes based on those ingredients.

I can't find the site, does anyone know which?

I remember that as you clicked the orange ingredients label (where were separated by like meats, vegetables, herbs), the ingredients that didn't match would turn translucent. They had about 400 at the time. 

I liked it cuz you could just click and explore, rather than having to enter the ingredients.

Thanks in advance!",2020-04-26

Me trying to make something new and love it and want to share it,"Kioshis omletette by kioshi(who is me)

&#x200B;

I'm vegan but when I was vegetarian I loved eggs. So here is a recipe

These are amateur recipes that are really my attempts at making things but they taste so good.

I love experimenting and never look up how to cook something.

Get a copper pan that can hold some water. PUT water in it (It doesn't matter the amount just halfway.)

&#x200B;

Put some eggs in their( I use 13 but you will need 3 more eggs later on in the recipes) put a lid on the pan and put the stove on high. and now boil them eggs. Once it starts boiling put a timer down for 10 minutes.

After the timer goes off you can go the painful route or the easy way.

&#x200B;

The hard way is to stick your hand in the boiling water and put in a metal bowl.(THis is what I did the first time JUST DONT DO IT)

Take a colander pour pan contents in there now you got eggs

&#x200B;

Peel eggshells and put eggshells in the trash or something

&#x200B;

 take a metal bowl and put the hard-boiled eggs in the bowl now take a whisk and slice the eggs and whisk it into chopped hard-boiled eggs. 

**Now put**

Handful of diced pickles

Handful of diced tomatos

1 tsp salt

1/2 tsp pepper

1/4 cup of mayonaise or veganaise.

**Optional:** 

Couple of Olives

Relish

Guacamole

**NEXT PART**

Ok now mix heavily with wisk and sppoon wooden spoon just mix and chop that baby up until it looks mixed well.

&#x200B;

Now get some more eggs (the 3 i mentioned earlier) and crack and the3.  in a jug or container now

mix heavily  and crack them yolks. Now heat up a pan on high and put a cooking pan that you cook fried eggs on. 

Ok (**Im new to writing recipes I just want my recipes saved.)** now you want to pour some in the pan a nice big circle but dont pour all of it you should have gotten rid of a third of it.

Now put some egg salad on the egg thingy not too much just a nice flat layer.

Take a spatula and flatten it down 

&#x200B;

 After some time and the egg  is nearly cooked  you can roll up the egg and move it to the other side of the pan

&#x200B;

Next, you want to pour another circle right next to the rolled-up egg and put two slices of pepper cheese or whatever cheese you like. now roll that over if you have any leftover repeat this one more time with egg salad that's a lot of omelettes you can also use the egg salad separately in sandwiches.

&#x200B;

Thank you hope you enjoy it

Question about digital cookbooks,"This might not be appropriate for this sub but not sure where else to post. I have a family cookbook that everyone loves and want to digitize it for the next generation in my family instead of reprinting it. I'm doing this for two reasons. One, have the ability to share easily and two, so that people can comment on their favorites or changes that they have made to the recipe.

I'm curious if any one has a platform they prefer for sharing recipes, what do you like about it and what you find lacking. I had originally suggested Google drive or Dropbox but my family didn't seem to like that idea.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.",2020-04-26

What‚Äôs an alternate use to kirsch?,I‚Äôm making a Swiss merengue and strawberry cake next week and one of the key flavourings  is an alcoholic drink called kirsch a clear brandy with a hint of cherry.

Deconstructed Chilaquiles,"I've been messing with this recipe for a little while, and I wanted to see what changes or additions might be made. It's fairly simple and makes for a fun breakfast. The base recipe uses Gordon Ramsay's French-Style scrambled eggs, with my own twists. I grew up in San Diego and the Inland Empire, so Mexican food has a special place in my clogged heart

_Ingredients_
- 3 eggs
- 1 Tbsp butter
- 2 Tbsp cooked Chorizo (pork or beef)
- 1 Tbsp Mexican Crema
- Cotija cheese
- Red or Green enchilada sauce
- Cilantro
- Corn or Flour Tortilla Chips (FRESH is better if you know how to make them, but don't get some name brand if you buy them, get the bags made fresh from your local Mexican restaurant or grocery, get a hearty chip, no super thin ones)
- (optional) refried beans
- (optional) small can of diced green chiles

_Directions_

First saute the Chorizo until fully cooked and crumbly. Remove from pan to paper towel lined plate to remove excess grease. Set aside

[Prepare the scrambled eggs as shown here](https://youtu.be/PUP7U5vTMM0). The only substitution would be using the Mexican Crema instead of Cr√©me Fraiche to halt/shock the eggs from overcooking. Fold in the cooked Chorizo and season to taste. Fold in green chiles at this point as well for added heat. Move to serving bowl and top with cotija and cilantro 

Warm the refried beans and sauce in separate small serving bowls. 

Serve almost like a Chip-Dip Bar. Dipping your chip first in the Red or Green sauce, then beans, and finally scooping up some of the scrambled eggs

Key Lime Mousse Pie,"**Ingredients**

10 oz walnuts, pecans, almonds, or graham crackers

1/3 cup butter, ghee, or coconut oil, melted

2 1/3 cup sugar

4 tsp cornstarch

5 tbsp cold water

1 cup key lime juice (or just regular lime juice)

4 large eggs

4 large egg yolks

3/4 cup butter, cubed

6 large egg whites

1/2 cup sugar

 2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream

2 limes, cut in half and thinly sliced for garnish

**Instructions**

*For the crust:*

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the nuts/crackers in a food processor and process until they are in fine crumbs and pour in the melted butter/oil. Process again until the mixture looks like wet sand. Pour the crumbs into a 10"" springform pan and press them down to create an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Bake the crust for 15 minutes, then let cool at room temperature.

*For the Key Lime Curd:*

Pour the gelatin powder into a tiny saucepan and pour the cold water over it. Allow this to bloom--it should take about 5 minutes and will remain in bloom until ready to be used.

Meanwhile, put the 2 1/3 cups sugar and the 4 tsp cornstarch into a medium size sauce pan and whisk together. Add in the 4 eggs and 4 egg yolks and whisk until combined. Add in the lime juice and whisk to combine. Add in the cubed butter. Place the pan onto a stove and turn up to medium heat. 

Whisk the curd mixture CONTINUOUSLY (very important or else it may burn and stick to the pan), keeping over medium heat. This takes 20-30 minutes so be prepared to get an arm workout. After 20-30 minutes, the mixture will start to thicken to a pudding-like consistency and start to boil. At this point, remove the pan from the heat.

Put the pan with the bloomed gelatin over the heat and allow it to dissolve completely. Pour the dissolved gelatin into the warm curd and whisk to combine. 

Transfer the curd to a medium/large bowl and cover with plastic wrap touching the surface of the curd (This prevents it from forming a skin). Allow to cool to room temp until the bottom of the bowl is cool enough to touch. Transfer the bowl to the fridge to continue cooling.

*For the remainder of the filling:*

As the curd cools, whip the egg whites with an electric mixer in a **large** bowl until they form soft peaks. Add in the 1/2 cup sugar, and continue whipping until they form stiff peaks. In a separate bowl, whip the 2 cups heavy whipping cream until it forms stiff peaks.  By now, the curd should be cool. If not, wait to proceed until the curd is fully cooled and put the egg whites and cream in the fridge. Once the curd is cool, pour the curd into the whipped egg whites, and fold them together, careful not to lose too much volume.  Set aside 1/2 cup of the whipped cream. Take the remaining cream and carefully fold it into the curd/egg white mixture until all is fully combined. Pour this main mixture into the springform pan and evenly spread it around. Cool until solid. Once solid, use the lime slices and the cream set aside to decorate however you want. Remove from springform pan, slice, and enjoy!",2020-04-30

Currently, I am pregnant with my first child, and idk if I‚Äôm just thinking about it too much or if I am actually craving something that no longer exists. Iv tried to recreate it for myself but to no avail. I can‚Äôt find a copy cat recipe anywhere and have no idea where to look. I know theres recipes for chicken Caesar wraps in general, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going to taste the same.

**Ingredients:**

1. 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil

2. 2 cloves of garlic poached (not peeled)

3. 1 chilli pepper

4. 10 cherry tomatoes or date tomatoes

5. 150 gr tuna (tuna in oil, net weight)

7. 400 gr paccheri (the ones in the picture) or rigatoni 

8. 1 leaf of basil 

9. q.s. sea salt

10. q.s. black pepper

**Method:**

2. Chop the cherry tomatoes.

3. Put the oil into the pan, at medium-high heat. Add the garlic and (optional) chilli pepper. After few minutes, add the tomatoes and some basil.

4. When the tomatoes have released their water (help this gently squeezing them with a wooden spoon) add the tuna and lower the heat. Salt and pepper according to your taste.

5. In the meanwhile, salted water should be boiling so that you can drop the paccheri into it.

6. After about 6-7 minutes, the sauce is ready and the paccheri are half-cooked.

7. Time to drain the pasta into the pan. Don't waste the water, you will need some to finish cooking the paccheri.

8. Finish cooking the paccheri in the pan, gently mixing them with the sauce and adding some pasta water (about 10 minutes). When paccheri are almost ready, add the shrimps: they need just 1 minute to be ready

9. Your shrimps and tuna paccheri are ready. Serve them with that delicious sauce and enjoy!

Dal Makhani is a delicacy from Punjab in India. Traditionally this dal was cooked slowly, for hours, on charcoal. This gave it a creamier texture. But we don‚Äôt have hours or charcoal in our kitchen so with many error and trials I think I got it on the head.

Super Thick Cookie Recipe,"So, there's a local bakery that makes giant thick cookies (we're talking like an inch and a half thick at least) that are absolutely delicious. My wife loves them, and since I'm more of the baker in the family, the task to recreate them falls on me üòú  
There are two recipes in particular I'm looking to recreate.

1. Honey Lemon Ginger (see this post for an example: [https://www.instagram.com/p/B9McpcNnqAb/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9McpcNnqAb/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link))
2. Confetti (another example: [https://www.instagram.com/p/B7bm\_\_jHtlq/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7bm__jHtlq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)) 

I've heard various means of making your cookies thick, but I haven't found a recipe to make a similar cookie to those above. Especially the Confetti cookie (maybe I'm searching for the wrong thing, I'm looking sugar cookie, but I get the thin Christmas cookies instead of the thick delicious monstrosity posted above).

"Pizza Masters -- How do I get a crispy, yet light (not dense/bready) crust?","I'm not sure how to explain what I'm talking about, but most definitely the answer is unhealthy --

While I do love pizza, I'm someone who generally does not eat pizza crust, because it is usually not worth the calorie/carb intake to me. However, there have been exactly two pizza experiences in my 30+ years of life where I have actually not only enjoyed the crust, but possibly enjoyed it more than main the pizza itself, making it totally worth it. It almost tasted like it was fried... the bread inside was light and almost flakey rather than dense, and the outside had the perfect amount of crispy delicious texture. There was obviously oil or butter involved, but there was more to it -- the texture of the internal bread was so perfect as well. Does anyone know how to create that? I've always shied away from making my own pizza since I am so particular about the crust, but I'm anticipating an excess of garden tomatoes and peppers this year that would be perfect for sauce and fresh ingredients.",2020-05-06

Roast Chicken & Sweet Potatoes," 

## Ingredients

Ingredient Checklist

* 2 tablespoons whole-grain or Dijon mustard
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dried
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* ¬Ω teaspoon salt, divided
* ¬Ω teaspoon freshly ground pepper, divided
* 1 1/2-2 pounds bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed
* 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 large red onion, cut into 1-inch wedges

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

* **Step 1**Position rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 450 degrees F. Place a large rimmed baking sheet in the oven to preheat.
* **Step 2**Combine mustard, thyme, 1 tablespoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a small bowl; spread the mixture evenly on chicken.
* **Step 3**Toss sweet potatoes and onion in a bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven and spread the vegetables on it. Place the chicken on top of the vegetables.

## Tips

Cut Down on Dishes: A rimmed baking sheet is great for everything from roasting to catching accidental drips and spills. For effortless cleanup and to keep your baking sheets in tip-top shape, line them with a layer of foil before each use.

The Ol' Beef Wellington," 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dgj3v0suzcx41.jpg?width=864&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e0012deb8c684f078bd9994612a06874a50c6a0

**TLDR Its not hard, just a lot of steps. Seal beef, pate, mushroom duxelles, prosciutto, pastry, bake, done,**

I don't get to cook much but I enjoy it when I do. All quantities depend on the amount of beef, I had 800g and it fed 4 with a quarter left over. So maybe 150g per person but keep in mind the end pieces aren't as good.

&#x200B;

# Ingredients; 

* Fillet Beef 800g 
* Duck Pate 
* Chestnut Mushrooms 4 or 5
* Prosciutto 10 slices
* Puff Pastry 340g
* White wine
* Butter
* Olive oil
* Eggs 3 large
* Salt, Pepper.

&#x200B;

# Method;

Preheat oven, 200c for a fan oven. Seal the beef on a pan in olive oil, stick it into the oven at 200c for ten minutes (I didn't bother covering it) then take it out and leave to cool. Once it's cold, spread a thin layer of pate all over. I only used a few spoonfuls.

Finely chop four or five chestnut mushrooms, or any mushrooms for that matter, and simmer in butter until the mushroom water cooks away. Add salt, pepper and stir. Add a splash of dry white wine and simmer. I think this is called a duxelles, so add onions or shallots and thyme if you want. Reduce to a chunky paste then leave to cool.

Now the fun part! On top of cling film, lay out the prosciutto. I used 10 slices overlapped 2x5 so it would easily cover the whole piece of beef. Evenly spread out the mushrooms keeping a quarter to the side. Place the beef (covered in pate) in the centre and the rest of the mushroom across the top. Then roll the whole sucker up tight. So you've got beef, pate, shrooms and prosciutto wrapped in cling film. Put this into the fridge for 30mins, or even overnight.

Pastry is next, and is done in two parts. First step is to go buy pre-made pastry, I used 320g and it was plenty. Roughly one third is used for the base. Roll it out until its about 2cm bigger on all sides than your beef, and lay onto parchment on an oven tray. Take the beef out of the fridge, remove the cling film, and place in the centre. Egg yolk can be brushed around the edge of the bottom pastry to help it stick to the top but to be honest, I forgot this part and nothing bad happened. 

Roll out the rest of your pastry, not too thin, and drape it over the top. Brush the whole top with egg yolk, use a fork to connect the two pieces around the side and the back of a knife to gently mark diagonal lines over the top careful not to cut the pastry. I re-brushed the egg yolk on top , then cut off the excess pastry leaving roughly 1cm.

And voila! All we need to do is cook. My oven is terrible, alway 10-20c hotter than it should be so I preheated to 190c, put it in the centre without covering with the intention of leaving it for 20-25min for med-rare. Then leave it for 10mins before serving. However, the pastry was cooked after 15mins. I let it sit for 15min then served.

It was still pretty good, I like my beef as rare as possible. Cut it into thick slices when serving, it helps the pastry stay together.

Twice Cheesed Mac and Cheese,"Hello everyone! I unfortunately forgot to take a photo of this meal but I assure you it is some of the best Mac and Cheese I have ever had.  


Ingredients: 
-Green Onions
-1 Clove of minced garlic
-half a cup of mushrooms
-butter
-your choice of noodle
-1 Jalapeno
-all purpose flour
-italian bread crumbs
-your choice in cheeses (I used a four cheese blend in addition to pepper jack and mushroom/scallion jack, Jalapeno havarti would be a delicious option and it is very creamy and melty).
-Heavy whipping cream
-Milk (at least 2%)
-Salt and Pepper


Instructions: Dice the green onions and mushrooms. When cutting the Jalapeno, cut it as though it were a bell pepper so as to avoid adding seeds (cut length wise in thin slices and then dice the slices).  Set aside some of the green onions to save as a garnish.


In a large cast iron skillet or nonstick pan heat 1 tbsp of butter (doesn't need to be exact just enough to oil the pan). Once melted add the onions, mushrooms, jalapeno and minced garlic. Cook for a few minutes until soft. Add 1.5 tbsp of all purpose flour and continually mix into the vegetables until it is dissolved. Boil a pot of water and cook the noodles while you prepare the vegetables.


Next add 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of milk. Continuously stir and allow to thicken. You will know it is thick enough when you run your stirring spoon along the bottom of the pan and the roux does not immediately fill the space. Once it has thickened sufficiently, remove from the heat and take one handful of shredded cheese, add and mix. Add only one handful at a time to allow each clump to fully melt and mix into the roux. In total I added 3 handfuls of cheese. I added salt and pepper to taste after adding the cheese in because different cheeses are saltier than others. When the roux was finished, I added a thin layer of cayenne pepper into the roux. If you add too much cheese the sauce will be too thick and may not be as good when mixed with the noodles.


In a small pan add some butter and your desired amount of bread crumbs. Allow the bread crumbs to slightly brown but make sure to continually stir so they do not burn. I also added some cayenne to the bread crumbs to add some spice to the garnish.


Now the reason this is called twice cheesed mac and cheese is because you will store the mac and cheese in the fridge after making it. I know you must be thinking?!?!?! Mac and cheese is terrible the next day, it is no longer creamy. Well the next day make a second roux and another round of cheese. I also added some more cayenne pepper the next day. Then combine the mac and cheese into the new roux and warm in a pan.  It is fantastic and you can honestly choose different cheeses every time, you may just want to remove the mushrooms or jalapenos depending on what you choose.


Serve the Mac n‚Äô Cheese and garnish with bread crumbs and fresh green onion. We also added some more shredded cheese on top as a garnish.


I honestly discovered this after my wife and I had the initial dish of mac and cheese which is still phenomenal. We had left overs but it was cheesy but dry so I made another cheese sauce and damn was it good. Because it was left overs some of the bread crumbs from the day before were already in the mac and cheese which was quite nice. This recipe is difficult to mess up. Have fun with it and let me know what you think!",2020-05-07

The Best Beef Stroganoff with Homemade Spaetzle -- Tried Many Variations and This is My Favorite,"[BEEF STROGANOFF!](https://imgur.com/3hOpOMK)  My favorite.

During the lockdown I've been cooking my favorite dish over and over, trying different recipes and attempting to make it perfect. There was a German restaurant I went to as a kid all the time and I've never been able to make it as well as they did. Today, I think I've gotten pretty darn close.  

The Spaetzle is a game changer. You don't need any specialized tools to make it either, and it works out really well!

**For the Spaetzle:**

* In a large bowl, whisk 4 eggs together with about 1/3rd cup of milk, a few pinches of kosher salt, and 2 cups of AP Flour.
* You want a relatively thick, but still ""runny"" consistently. It should stick to the whisk and flow off it slowly. You can add more milk or flour to adjust accordingly.
* (Optional) You can add some creme fraiche to the mixture, or spices of your choosing, (nutmeg, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, etc.) while not traditional it can be fun to play around with.
* Have water boiling once your batter is ready
* To make the Spaetzle shape, there are specific tools for the job, but you really don't need one. You can use the back side (non sharp side) of a cheese grater (the larger holes) to push the tough through. You know you have the right consistency of dough if you can place it on top of the holes, but it won't fall through unless you push it. Personally, I used a potato ricer which made perfect shapes. Hell, you can even use a colander-- anything with holes in it you can push the dough through a little at a time. 
* In small batches push the tough through your holed object of choice directly into the boiling water. They cook very quickly! They are done once the float to the top of the pot. If the clump together give them a second to harden, and loosen them up into their individual shapes with a rubber spatula or similar.
* Fish out of the water with a slotted spoon, wok skimmer, or similar and transfer to a bowl and repeat. Season to your liking-- my personal favorite would be adding butter, nutmeg with a bit of garlic and white pepper.
* That's your Spaetzle! Super easy and my god are these little bastards perfect with stroganoff. Cover/keep warm while you cook the stroganoff.

**For the Beef Stroganoff**

What You'll Need:

1. Steak cut of your choice (sirloin is what I use)
2. Half of a large yellow onion -- about 1 cup -- finely chopped 
3. Sliced white button mushrooms -- about 2 cups -- (mushroom to onion about a 2:1 ratio)
4. Minced garlic to your taste
5. About a half cup of heavy cream
6. Prepared horseradish (NOT just the sauce/condiment, you'll need to look for this at the store, trust me it makes a big difference)
7. About 1 to 2 cups of beef broth
8. Sour Cream
9. Worcester Sauce
10. Butter
11. Olive Oil
12. Fresh Thyme and Parsley
13. Something to deglaze with (can be broth, red wine, cognac, bourbon, etc.)

* I eyeball a lot of this, some aspects you add to thicken or thin the sauce as you see necessary. I don't like giving precise measurements as I feel they can be restrictive-- have fun and adjust to taste!
* You're gonna want to do all your prep work first, mise en place is a real helpful thing. Have all the ingredients ready to go and save yourself some hassle.
* Start with the meat of your choice, I personally use sirloin. You can cook the steaks whole or slice them first, it's up to you, really. I find it easier to get a uniform medium-rare doneness if cooking the steaks whole, but there is more surface area to brown if you slice them beforehand.
   * If slicing beforehand, it helps if the meat is ever-so-slightly frozen in order to cut them thin. Cutting against the grain, slice into 1/2 to 1/4 inch strips. Season with salt and pepper. Some people dredge them in flour to help with browning, I find this unnecessary though. Up to you.
* Heat some olive oil in a large, fairly deep pan over medium-high heat. I use a shallow dutch oven. You can add some butter here too, but be careful not to burn it.
* Once sufficiently hot, add in your steak, cooking until browned on one side. Then, individually flip each piece to the other side (yes, don't just toss them around the pot, trust me.) Wait for the second side to brown and to form a nice layer of fond on the bottom of your pot.
* Once the steaks are approaching medium-rare, remove them from the pot and set them aside. It's okay if they're a little undercooked here, as you'll be re-adding them to the sauce for a few minutes later on. It's VERY EASY to over-cook your steak in this recipe, so try and keep an eye on that.
* Into the same pot, add a bit more butter and add the finely chopped onions and sliced mushrooms, stirring frequently. I typically add onions first and give them a few minutes head start to cook in the liquids. Let them cook for about 8-10 minutes or until soft/translucent.
   * **\*\*NOTE:\*\*** Mushrooms are like sponges, they're gonna absorb almost all of your oil and butter making the pan look dry. Resist the urge to keep adding oil/butter because once they become relaxed in the sauce they're going to release a lot of it, giving you an oil slick if you overdo it.
* Once mushrooms and onions are soft and golden, add in the minced garlic. Cook for only about 30 seconds or until fragrant. Garlic burns very quickly! Literally only about 30 seconds to a minute tops.
* Deglaze with red wine, bourbon, whiskey, cognac, etc... scraping off all that delicious fond from the bottom of the pot. It has tons of flavor so be sure to remember this step. If you don't want to use alcohol, you can simply use the broth to deglaze as well. Give the alcohol a few moments to cook off entirely.
* Add in the beef broth and bring to a low boil, stirring frequently.  
* Add in some fresh thyme, and about a tablespoon of prepared horseradish.
   * Some people have also added a small amount of vermouth here, I've not tried this but hear it can be quite nice.
* Add in a few table spoons of worcester sauce.
* Pour in about a half cup to a cup of heavy cream. Let this all boil down and reduce for about 20-30 minutes, stirring frequently. Make sure you don't let anything burn onto the bottom of the pan.
* Salt + Pepper to taste
* Once sauce is nice and thickened add in your sour cream. Again, I eyeball this, but usually use about half a cup to a cup's worth of it. You want that nice, creamy light-brown color in your sauce.
   * To prevent curdling, it helps to temper the sour cream. Have it in a cup or bowl, and add a tiny amount of your pan sauce to the sour cream, mixing it in a little at a time. Once you have a slurry you can add it all to the sauce. This helps it adjust to the temperature and will avoid that nasty curdling.
* Continue to cook for a few more minutes until the sauce is nice and thick.
   * If your sauce is not thick enough, you can always mix flour with cold water, and add it in to help it thicken. Be sure to give the sauce ample time to cook the flour though, nothing tastes worse than raw flour.
* TASTE! See if your sauce is missing salt or pepper-- perhaps it needs a little something extra. Use your instincts ! 
* Once happy, re-introduce the steak to the pot, giving it a few minutes to warm up and absorb the sauce.
   * You can add your spaetzle into the pot too, but I prefer to plate them separately. 
* Plate a large portion of spaetzel and spoon on your steak/sauce on top. Garnish with freshly ground pepper and finely chopped parsley.
* Eat way too much because its delicious and pass out face-down on the floor.

There you have it, my favorite dish on this planet so far. Like I stated, after trying multiple ways to cook this, I find this method the best one so far. The prepared horseradish may seem a little odd, but it really elevates the flavor.",2020-05-08

A perfect Colby jack bbq bacon sandwich.,"You start off by toasting two pieces of bread, get them set up next to your pan. You then cut 4 pieces of bacon in half so you have 8 bread size strips. You salt the bacon, don't go too heavy, but don't be afraid to really lay it on there. Then you cook the bacon, but only until it's darkened, not crispy. You then put those onto your toasted bread. Then, mince up an eighth of an onion, (preferably red) and you cook them in the bacon grease to the point right before they're burnt, caramelize them, you then put them on the sandwich, put on two slices of Colby jack cheese, and some sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce. You then close up the sandwich, microwave it for 15 seconds for the cheese to melt, then serve. I guarantee they will be satisfied.",2020-05-10

Help with very savory and almost fluffy Palak or Saag Chicken!,"I have been making saag chicken for about a year now following an adapted version of [this recipe](https://www.veganricha.com/instant-pot-vegan-chicken-saag-soy-curls-in-spinach-sauce/).  I thought it was amazing, until my SO and I recently started ordering carry out from a local joint.  I make some changes to the posted recipe, which I will list at the end of the post, but what I'm wanting to know is how to make it like this carry out joint.  I mean, theirs blows ours out of the water.  It tastes like they use a very reduced chicken broth because every bite, even without chicken is savory.  Furthermore, it holds its shape so well; its almost pudding!  What is the secret?!  


Here are some things that are almost definitely holding me back:

1) i blend my greens (spinach and baby arugula or baby kale).  i likely blend them too much.  should i just roughly chop them by hand so they dont get so messed up?  maybe gradually toss them in a food processor?  not chop them at all?

2) i tried using bone broth but the spinach releases so much liquid that if you use very much at all, it'll turn souplike

3) for aromatics, the recipe i'm using uses onion, ginger,  hot green pepper, garam masala, and bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon sticks, and cayenne pepper.  optionally, you can use fenugreek leaves, which i hear makes a big difference.  i've ordered some so i can try next time.

4) this is a vegan recipe, so they skip the ghee.  maybe i should give it a whirl.

&#x200B;

My changes to the posted recipe are:

* Use a pressure cooker instead of an instapot, and it's huge so it takes longer to heat up than a normal one would.
* Use chicken thighs instead of soy curls
* Dont measure the tomatoes.  I just double the recipe and use 1-2 large ones
* I toss in more liquid than I should.  That's got to play a role in its semi shapelessness
* I don't exactly know what they mean by spicy green chili, so i use serrano

&#x200B;

Nutella Oatmeal Pudding!,"Hi everyone! This is something I‚Äôve been making A Lot during quarantine whenever I‚Äôm craving something quick, sweet, and filling. It‚Äôs super easy and it‚Äôs so good I wanted to share. 

Ingredients:

1/2 c. oatmeal (I‚Äôd say rolled oats would be best)
1/2 c. water
1/2 c. milk (of your choice)
1 tbsp Nutella (you can adjust for your own taste, I prefer it semi-sweet so I do a regular tbsp) 
Pinch of salt

Preparation: 

Bring the 1/2 c. water and milk to a boil in a small saucepan with a pinch of salt. Turn the heat down to low and add the oatmeal, stirring often until it‚Äôs thick but there‚Äôs still some liquid. Stir in the tbsp of Nutella until it‚Äôs all well mixed and let the mixture thicken up (we‚Äôre trying to get pudding consistency). Transfer to bowl and LET. IT. COOL. 

I know it‚Äôs tempting to eat it hot but trust me, it‚Äôs so much better once it‚Äôs a little cooler. It‚Äôs warm and comforting and delicious. If you want you can add stuff like cinnamon, nuts, raisins, etc. 

Let me know if you try it and like it!",2020-05-11

There were other ingredients, but I can't remember them. After stuffing the bread they would press it with some sort of panini press and serve. Can anyone find a recipe or know of any recipes?

Cheese filled chicken with the most delicious cheese crust!,"Hello my friends. This is going to be the first recipe i post, as i feel like i discovered a holy grail of my palate and feel the need to share.

So! here is my recipe for 2 servings of cheese filled crispy chicken!

ingredients:

\- 2 Chicken breasts

\- Grated  Parmigiano-Reggiano

\- Italian Mascarpone 

\- 1 Finely chopped garlic clove

\- Finely chopped basil

\- A bit of parsley for garnish

\- salt and pepper to taste

Direction:

1. In a small bowl, add the Mascarpone, finely chopped basil and the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and mix until the mascarpone has coated the Parmigiano
2. Finely dice your garlic clove and transfer them to a pan, cook until the garlic is slightly brown and has released the fragrance into the oil, when brown, take out the garlic and add it to the bowl of mascarpone, basil and parmigiano. your cheese mix is complete!
3. Cut a slash into the top of your chicken breast, and spoon the cheese mix into it (being left over with some cheese mix is a good thing, and we will use it later).
4.  Salt and pepper your chicken and turn your pan to high heat, and put the chicken in so the cheese mix is on top of the chicken, cook until the bottom is nice brown and crispy. about 5 minutes
5. After the chicken is finished on the bottom, flip the cheese side face down and let the chicken fry until it is finished, Do not flip your chicken back too soon otherwise you might not create the crust you are looking for. 
6. Take your leftover cheese mix, and a small pan on low heat, to melt the leftover cheese mix, and pour the cheesy goodness on the chicken, garnish with finely chopped parsley and voila! your amazing chicken is finished!

Personally my favourite side dish for this chicken would be a  amazingly creamy mashed potatoes

Taiwanese Braised Pork ‚Äì Lu Rou,"\[Sorry, no picture since my phone camera doesn't do it justice\]

A childhood classic for me! This is a super simple one pot recipe that's essentially to taste (as are most authentic Asian dishes), but here's a close approximation of what I usually do. Easy, savory, meaty, sticks to your ribs, and tastes even better as leftovers!

**Ingredients:**

* Vegetable oil
* 1 shallot (substitute 1/2 red onion)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 lb ground pork
* Mirin, Chinese rice wine, or white cooking wine
* Soy sauce
* Sesame oil
* Water
* Chinese five spice powder
* Recommended add-ins (cut into 1/2 cubes):
   * Mushrooms (I typically use shiitake or king oyster mushrooms, but something like bella or portabello would work too)
   * Dried marinated tofu

**Directions**:

1. Cut shallot into 1/2 cubes 
2. Add oil to a large pot and saut√© shallots and garlic over medium-high until the shallots are just starting to caramelize, about 5 minutes
3. Add ground pork to the pot and break up the pieces with a wooden spoon. Keep the mixture moving. You will start to see liquid start to render out
4. When pork is no longer pink, add a splash of mirin, about 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, about 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, and a few shakes of five spice (about 1/2 teaspoon). Give it a mix and add water until it just covers the pork
5. If desired, add cubed mushrooms and/or dried tofu at this step
6. Cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Stew the lu rou for 1 hour. Stir the pot every 15 minutes and add water if necessary
7. Taste for seasoning. If it's not salty enough, add more soy sauce. If it's too salty, add water
8. Traditionally served over short grain rice with a hardboiled egg, but it's also great served on top of thin rice noodles or congee. Be sure to drizzle on some of the soup!

Notes:

* Find ground pork with a good blend of meat and fat! The fat helps the stew turn out super flavorful and glossy, but too much will make it too greasy. If the lu rou becomes somewhat gelatinous after chilling, then you've done it right
* I personally recommend king oyster mushrooms as my add-in of choice, but you could use anything that stews well
* This is my mom's recipe! My boyfriend (who is also Taiwanese American) makes his with cubed pork belly. Lots of variations on lu rou, but this one is the most nostalgic for me",2020-05-13

How do you organize your recipes?,"Hi there,

I'm wondering if anyone has any tips on how they organize their physical recipes.  I have a few hundred of my favorites formatted nicely and all, but I can't decide on an organization.  Purely by name?  Organized into categories (cookies, cakes, breads, etc)?  One giant binder for them all or several small binders?  I run into problems because some overlap in categories, and sometimes the names (if I do them alphabetically) aren't the easiest to find something: I might forget the recipe I want for oatmeal cookies is under C for ""chewy oatmeal cookies.""

Just wondering what systems other people have?

Thanks!",2020-05-13

DIY Homemade Disney Dole Whip Very Easy Recipe,"Disney releases their dole whip ice cream couple weeks ago, although the recipe was very simple, but it didn't give the similar taste to what we have in Disney, so i made a slight alteration and here is my version of the dole whip ice cream, it is very easy to make!

Video instruction: [https://youtu.be/xfQs9ldm22U](https://youtu.be/xfQs9ldm22U)

Ingredients:

* 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream
* 4 ounces of pineapple juice
* 2 cups of frozen pineapple

Direction:

6. Scoop it with an ice cream scoop and put it in the cup, decorate a few pieces of pineapple on top, and you're done!

It called for boiling the mushrooms before putting in the marinate. The marinate was good, very flavorful, but since the mushrooms were boiled, they tasted watered down.

For those who are craving for the meatballs, here is the recipe that will help you to stay comfort.

I have also made a video for step by step for those who prefer visual guide, click the link to watch: [https://youtu.be/2NsZhWzr1Wg](https://youtu.be/2NsZhWzr1Wg)

**Ingredients for the meatballs:**

* Ground Beef 500 g (1lb)
* Ground Pork 250 g (¬Ωlb)
* 1 Onion finely chopped
* 1 Clove of Garlic (crushed or minced)
* Breadcrumbs 100 g (3.5oz)
* 1 egg
* Whole Milk 5Tbsp
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Ingredients for the cream sauce:**

* Butter 40g (1.4oz)
* Plain flour 40g (1.4oz)
* Vegetable stock 150ml (5oz)
* Beef stock 150ml (5oz)
* Double cream 150ml (5oz)
* Soy Sauce 2tsp
* Dijon Mustard 1tsp (optional)

**Instructions for meatballs:**

1. Combine beef and pork mince and mix thoroughly to break up any lumps.
2. Add finely chopped onion, garlic, breadcrumbs, egg, and mix. Add milk and season well with salt and pepper.
3. Shape mixture into small, round balls. Place on a clean plate, cover, and store in the fridge for 2 hours (to help them hold their shape while cooking).
4. In a frying pan, heat oil on medium heat. When hot, gently add your meatballs and brown on all sides.
5. When browned, add to an ovenproof dish and cover. Place in a hot oven, 350¬∞F/180¬∞C, and cook for a further 30 minutes. (Air-Fryer: 350¬∞F/180¬∞C cook for 10 minutes)

**Instructions for Cream Sauce:**

1. Melt the butter in a frying pan. Whisk in the plain flour and continue cooking, stirring continuously for 2 minutes.
2. Add the vegetable stock and beef stock and continue to stir. Add the thick double cream, soy sauce. (You can also add Dijon mustard or Bullhead Curry Paste.)
3. Bring to a simmer and allow the sauce to thicken. Continue to stir.
4. When ready to eat, serve with your favorite potatoes -- either creamy mash or mini new boiled potatoes.

Mozzarella in Carrozza! Reuse your old bread,"Do you know what you need for cooking ‚ÄúMozzarella in Carrozza‚Äù? You need to forget your bread for a couple of days!

(And to buy Mozzarella)! I really love them, I never tried to do them at home before, but the result was crazy tasty! So,

WHAT‚ÄôS IN THERE?

15 mins

3 old bread

250g of Mozzarella

3 Eggs

100g of bread crumbles

A bit of salt

Sunflower oil.

COOKING STEPS:

Cut the bread horizontally in 2 parts, fill it with Mozzarella and flatten it ‚ÄúVigorously‚Äù.

Put the eggs in a bowl add salt, whisk them and also prepare the bread crumbles.

Pass abundantly the bread in the egg whisked, then cover it adequately with crumbles.

Add oil in a pan, heat it, add the bread and fry it both side. Cut it and enjoy the melty Mozzarella!

LITTLE FUNNY FOOD FACT:

Did you know that the Mozzarella in Carrozza means Mozzarella in a coach? It really resembles the idea of someone inside a brown Coach! This dish comes traditionally from the Italian regions called Lazio and Campania. It was made to creatively use the excess of Mozzarella! (Lucky them, I never had this problem in my entire life).

Well Done, by reading until here you just enhanced your Culture!

Hot Chocolate question,"Hey I'm a terrible person with food, but I've recently started drinking a lot of hot chocolate. I tried the stuff you pour directly into cold milk and it's done but that's not HOT chocolate, that's just chemicals :/

So I got myself some 99% cocoa powder and started drinking hot chocolate by bringing water to a boil, putting 1-2 teaspoons of the powder in and 2-3 teaspoons of sugar into a regular cup, about 1 and 1/2 of a glass \~250-300 ml, I pour in water about 7/8 of the way and finish it with some cold milk.

And this sometimes works perfectly if I get the powder/sugar and water/milk combinations just right, but that's only 1/10 of the time, and the rest it's really unsatisfying and either too sweet or not chocolaty or watered down :/

What is the perfect combination of 99% cocoa powder to sugar to water to milk? I've googled this and only found some weird ""simple"" recipe's that involved almost boiling the milk itself and putting in actual chocolate to melt or something crazy like that, that wasn't that helpful as it probably takes longer than 20 seconds to make, so out of my skill range, and that isn't very wide, I usually just take some bread and some meat and eat them taking bites separately, instead of trying to cut the bread and do anything with it... x\_x Okay this turned out way too damn long:

"The Best, Multi Ribbon Winning Pie Crust Recipe","https://preview.redd.it/y73wuniba8051.jpg?width=936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f9f907ebde8ba6a669ac1e20c7fc6b7ca455562

I know most of you in here probably have mastered a pie crust of your own that works perfect for you! Maybe it's your moms, grandmothers, or maybe you've taken all the best pie recipes and made your own.

Well I'm feeling generous, and want to share a pie crust recipe my great grandma had came up with in the 1920's. (that my grandma had since modified.) This recipe has won my grandma multiple ribbons at state fair pie bake offs in the 90s, and my sister has just won two state pie bake offs this past couple of years using *this exact recipe*. It defies ALL laws of pastry making, and most of you will probably read the ingredients and instructions and exit out.... but I promise you, if you make this correctly, you will forget about your previous pie crust recipe.

What makes this pie crust so much different than any other pie crust you've made is -- **no cold ingredients.** Room temperature Butter Flavored Crisco, and *boiling* water. Yes....*boiling water*. Everyone thinks you HAVE to use cold water for a flakey sturdy crust -- but if you will see after making this, that is simply not true. My sister made it for her fiance's 88 yr old grandma's birthday, and she was blown away by how good the pie was and was asking how she made the crust. She eventually started a little side business in our hometown making personal pies, before going to school full time.

**INGREDIENTS:**2/3 cup + 2 tbsp of ***Butter Flavored*** ***Crisco***

1/4 cup of ***boiling*** **water**

2 tbsp of whole milk

1/4 of salt

2 cups + ""a little more"" of flour

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

Turn a pot of water on a boil. Mix the salt in the *room temperature butter flavored crisco* with a fork until well blended in the shortening. *Slowly,* start pouring the boiled water while mashing it in the shortening with your fork until it starts to mid, then begin whipping until it's the texture of sour cream. Add the milk and continue to mix. Once everything except the flour is well blended, begin adding the flour bit by bit, until the consistency right. This is enough for a double crust or lattice crust pie.

You *do not need* to refrigerate this. My grandmother never did, and would just roll it out on a floured surface after taking a little break. You can refrigerate it if you prefer though!

If you're not doing a double crust, or making a cream pie -- roll the dough out and make about 1.5-2 inch overlap of dough and the pan. This makes a very big, delicious crust above the filling that really allows you to taste this flakey, buttery goodness. Be sure not to overwork the dough!

I'm sorry I don't have any photos of the actual crust at the moment -- I'll see if I can get some from my fam and I'll update this post.  


**UPDATED:**  
Here are some photos of a crust I just made for a peanut butter pie!

Lavender White Chocolate Scones w/ lemon curd,"**Lavender White Chocolate Scones**

**Ingredients:**

* 2 and 3/4 cups of flour
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 cup cold butter
* 1/2 cup white chocolate
* 1 tablespoon dried lavender
* 3 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* Turbinado sugar

**Directions:**

In a large bowl, mix together flour, lavender, sugar, salt, and baking soda.

Dice the butter, then cut into the dry ingredients until most of the butter is pea sized.

Mix together 2 eggs, vanilla and almond extract, and heavy cream in a separate bowl.

Make a well in the dry ingredients, and pour in the wet ingredients.

Mix until dough comes together, adding heavy cream or flour in small amounts if needed. Mix in white chocolate. Don‚Äôt over-mix dough.

Place half of the dough mixture onto a covered, floured baking tray. Press the dough in a flat circle until it is about 6 inches across. Cut circle into 8 triangles and separate by one inch. Repeat with second half of dough.

Place scones in the refrigerator or freezer for half an hour.

Preheat oven to 425.

Whisk an egg and use a pastry brush to brush it onto the tops of the scones. Sprinkle liberally with coarse sugar.

Bake 18-20 minutes, or until the tops of the scones are golden brown.

Scones keep well for two days in an air-tight container or wrapped in plastic. They can be reheated in the oven.

 **Lemon Curd**

**Ingredients:**

* 6 teaspoons fresh lemon juice (from about 3 lemons)
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 4 large egg yolks
* Pinch of salt
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 2 teaspoons lemon zest

**Directions:**

Zest, then juice, lemons. Pass juice through a strainer to remove seeds.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk lemon juice, sugar, egg yolks, and salt. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly and scraping sides of pan until curd is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5-8 minutes. Do not let it boil or the curd will get lumpy. If this happens, pass through a fine strainer.

Remove from heat and whisk in butter one tablespoon at a time until smooth.

Stir in zest, then cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto curd so as not to form a skin.

Refrigerate until set, at least one hour.

Dulce de Leche cookie,"These to me are very similar to macaroons. This is also something that I thought of on my own.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
The first thing you need to do is make a slightly different Dulce de Leche. The way I made it was cooking on a pan. I opened two cans of sweetened condensed milk. Then, I cooked it in a pan until it was slightly thicker then the original thickness. This can take around 1 hour or maybe more. Once it is to that point, take it of the stove so it can cool down and thicken a little more. it shouldn‚Äôt be as dark as real Dulce de Leche, it should have a creamy look to it.

For the cookies, you‚Äôll make an altered cookie dough. If you make your own dough, you‚Äôll make it with about half of the baking powder it usually uses, and add more flour and sugar. You want the batter to be a little bit more wet than cut out cookie dough, but less then normal cookie dough.

If using a store bought cookie mix, add more flour sugar and butter to dilute the amount of baking powder in it.

Cut the cookie dough to be about the width of a toilet paper tube. Then cook them how the recipe calls for.

Once the cookies are cooled, re-heat the Dulce de Leche so it is softer, then make the cookies into sandwiches with the Dulce de Leche.",2020-05-23

Just some basic potato wedges.,"So yeah. I used 4. Chop into wedges. Put into a bowl with cold water. (I can't do the ice bath thing because I have a freezer full of food, no room for ice). I put the cold water bowl with wedges in fridge for an hour. (Takes out the starch mostly). Took 'em out, strained water. Patted wedges dry with paper towels.

Foil onto baking pan. Sprayed some Pam on it to prevent sticking. Wedges on, skin side down. Sprinkled Adobo, cayenne pepper, and basil on top. (Can use whatever spices you like of course). 

Then I splashed olive oil on top. (I know people say toss it in a bowl with olive oil. Not needed, and that's messy). Into the oven... 375 degrees for an hour. Done and delicious. 

Eat as is, or with ketchup, or dip in sour cream. Banging!",2020-05-23

**White Kurma Curry (Coconut curry)** 

FOR           THE RAW GROUND PASTE

1 cup fresh shredded coconut

1/4 cup cashews

1 clove

2 cardamom

1 inch cinnamon

1 tablespoon fennel seeds

2 green chillies

BOILED           VEGETABLES

1 cup carrots

1 cup beans

1 cup potatoes

1 cup peas

OTHER           INGREDIENTS

2 tablespoon peanut oil

1 teaspoon fennel seed

1 teaspoon cumin seed

2 sprigs curry leaves (optional)

1 medium onion, chopped

1 teaspoon salt

1 tablespoon cornstarch or maida

  

INSTRUCTIONS

Raw ground paste: Grind all the ingredients with about 1-2           cups of water to a smooth paste.

Boil about 4 cups of mixed vegetables until al-dente and keep           aside.

Heat the oil in a saute pan. Add in a teaspoon each of cumin           seeds, fennel seeds and 2 sprigs of curry leaves. Let it splutter.           Add in the chopped onions and salt. Saute till slightly brown. Add in           the ground masala paste and let it simmer in low flame for about 5           minutes.

Once the raw smell goes, after 5 minutes add the boiled           vegetables. Take a small cup and add a tablespoon of cornstarch or           maida (All purpose flour). Add 1/2 cup water to it and make a slurry.           Add the slurry to the gravy. The slurry helps in thickening the           gravy. Do not add the corn starch or maida directly as it may lump           up. Simmer for couple of minutes more.

Serve hot with roti or chapati.

Homemade Brown Sugar Tapioca Boba for Bubble Tea Lovers,"&#x200B;

recently i find craving for bubble tea so strong that I can't get any of those from nearby due to many bubble tea shops are closed due to current circumstances, so I decided to made my own, I bought the Tapioca flour from costco (also found them on Amazon too). and I have to say, it turns out to be great and it was actually quite easy to make, so I thought to share this recipe to those who loves bubble tea and want to try making it home from scratch, it is easy to store and also you can adjust the sweetness of the balls by adding more or less brown sugar to it.

here is the video recipe for those who are interested: [https://youtu.be/E\_il4ZLaf6A](https://youtu.be/E_il4ZLaf6A)

**Ingredient:**

**{Boba}**

* Tapioca 100g (¬æ Cup+1Tbsp)
* Brown Sugar 45g (3Tbsp)
* Water 60ml (¬º Cup)
* Brown Sugar 30g (2Tbsp)

**{Molasses}**

* Brown Sugar 100g (¬Ω Cup)
* Water 60ml (¬º Cup)
* Honey 15g (1Tbsp)

**Direction:**

1. Add 3 Tbsp of water and brown sugar to the pot and cook over medium-low heat until the brown sugar melts.
2. After boiling, add half of the tapioca powder and stir quickly for 15 seconds before turning off the heat.
3. After turning off the heat, add the remaining half of tapioca powder to the pot and stir to form a lump.
4. After kneading the dough until it is smooth and smooth, use a rolling pin to flatten the dough.
5. Cut the flattened dough into small cubes 1 cm in size.
6. Rub the small cubes into a round ball, you can pick up some cassava powder to prevent sticking.
7. Sift the excess cassava powder from the outer layer of the powder circle.
8. After the water boils, add the powder circles and stir to prevent the powder circles from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
9. Stir until the water boils again, cover the pot and simmer for 15 minutes.
10. Wait for 15 minutes, turn off the heat, open the lid, and after stirring again, cover the lid and let it sit for 10 minutes.
11. Remove the powder balls, add 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and mix well to prevent the powder balls from sticking and at the same time to allow the powder balls to absorb the sweetness of brown sugar.
12. Boil {Black Molasses}, add water, brown sugar, and honey to the pot and cook on medium-low heat until small bubbles appear and become thick. Pour into a bottle and store it in a refrigerator.

"Thick, Delicious Chocolate Brownie in a Mug!","1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup sugar
2 Tablespoons of cocoa
1/4 cup water
2 Tablespoons melted butter (I just stuck it in the microwave for about 30 secs and mushed it up)
Drop of vanilla extract (like 1/8 of a tablespoon)
A bunch of chocolate chips, I didn't really measure these. 

Method - 
mix up all the dry ingredients in a mug until it's all a light brown colour
Mix in water, butter and vanilla extract
Put in your chocolate chips or chunks and mix them in
Put in the Microwave for 1 minute - 2 minutes (depends on the power of your microwave)
Serve with a scoop of ice cream or cream.

What Greek soup is this?,"As a 20 year old in 1986 I remember a most wonderful soup sold in a small village in the Corinthian mountains. The butcher sold it every Friday evening and the whole village seemed to come to his once a week taverna consisting of a ramshackle of tables and chairs outside and just one dish on the menu. 

As far as I remember it was a combination of some sort of stock, lemon juice and olive oil. Served with plenty of bread it was absolutely delicious.

Does anyone know what the soup might have been? And if so, does anyone have a local recipe?

Recipes for sandwiches,"Hey guys!

So, long story short, my mom and I are continuing our family restaurant (used to be classic Belgian-French kitchen) since my aunt got out of the business. However, we want to focus more on sandwiches, panini and salads and some 100% homemade dishes like stoofvlees (belgian meat stew), vol au vent, soup, lasagna, etc.

Now, the traditional way of making a sandwich over here (we call it a 'broodje') is a small baguette with meat or cheese or whatever and toppings. Like Subway style but without the processed stuff.

Anyways, I'm looking for recipe ideas, neat combinations that we don't have here back in Belgium, because everyone always does the same stuff. And preferably also possible to turn into a salad (isn't mandatory but we have to take food expense really serious after this COVID stuff). I'm also looking for several bread options. Like, would you want your sandwich to be on bread? Baguette? Pistolet? Maybe, if possible in panini or salad style?

Sorry if I sound a bit all over the place, it's hard to explain since I usually speak Dutch/Flemish.

Please, hit me with your best combo ideas!

(Also good to know, we do love ourself a royal portion of meat or charcuterie, but over here we're quite keen on eating cold sandwiches with lots of veggies on top as well. Plus, it's a big restaurant and at some times my mom or me would have to run the place alone, both kitchen and FOH, so standing behind the stove for a while will be difficult.)",2020-05-28

Primary school Chocolate concrete recipe?," Hi guys. I was wondering if anyone has a good chocolate concrete recipe? You know the sort you used to get at primary school (if your from the UK). If you haven't heard of this before it is like a really hard, crunchy chocolate brownie that is topped with a sprinkle of sugar

We have tried a recipe that called for:

215g self raising flour

160g margarine

160g caster sugar

20g coca powder

1 egg

1tbs baking powder

1tbs vanilla extract

The result was a sort of brownie that tasted pretty good but it was dusty and broke apart rather than being hard and crunchy like it should be. If anyone has a good recipe of their own or ideas on how to amend ours i'd love to hear it! Thx :)",2020-05-29

Tandoori Chicken in home-oven is just as good as restaurant. Figured out a recipe after couple trials that I am sticking with. Details below. :),"  

Hadn‚Äôt made Indian food at home in a while. So, I decided to experiment with Tandoori Chicken in my home oven, First try turned out so good that I ended up making a video for my channel.   
 Moral of the story? Tandoori Chicken four times a week is good for the soul. :D  
 

Video is [here](https://youtu.be/ZRyPH4Z0Ki8) if someone is interested. Just a photo is [here](https://imgur.com/OXH3Ag3)!  
 Thanks for supporting a small channel in advance. :)  
 

Recipe is very simple and here goes‚Ä¶

Ingredients:

**For marinating**:   
 1. Chicken, any cut: 1 kg or 2LBS \[we used drumsticks\]   
 2. Yogurt : 1 cup or 8 oz   
 3. Lime juice: from half a lime   
 4. Garam Masala: 1 tbsp   
 5. Red chili powder: 2 tsp   
 6. salt: 1 tsp   
 7. Ginger paste: 1.5 tbsp   
 8. Garlic paste: 1.5 tbsp 

**For Chili rub**: Optional but recommended to get the reddish color like restaurants.  
 1. Paprika: 1/2 tbsp   
 2. Oil: 1 tbsp   
 3. Lime juice: 1 tbsp   
 4. salt: 1 tsp

**Steps:**

1. Marinade chicken in all the ingredients. Cover and set aside for 40 mins. If you‚Äôre leaving it on the countertop, make sure it‚Äôs not too hot.

2. Preheat oven to highest mark. That was 500 F for me. Move the wire rack as close to the top as possible.

3. After the 40mins of rest is done, place chicken on lined sheet tray and brush the chili rub over it. Since Paprika is not too hot, this won‚Äôt add to the heat much but will give a great reddish color.

4. If not using rub, drizzle over some oil to ensure the chicken is moist and browns well.

5. Cook in the preheated oven until you get desired browning on the skin. Then, move to a lower rack and reduce oven to 450f to finish cooking, if needed.

6. Garnish with lime or lemon juice and fresh coriander leaves, and a side of mint chutney for maximum satisfaction!

Thanks for reading. Happy cooking, reddit. :)",2020-05-29

How to Italian cuisine - learn how to cook: Sweet and sour pepperoni," [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrHkLs-XHw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrHkLs-XHw) 

&#x200B;

 4 savings  

time of preparation: 45min or less  

&#x200B;

Ingredients:   

\- 2-3 Pepperoni depending on the size

 \- Salt - Sugar 

\- Apple cider Vinegar 

\- Olive oil   

&#x200B;

Procedure: 

Start by cleaning up the interior of the pepperoni like you see in the video and slice them up in quite big squares. Put some olive oil in a pan with a peel of lemon, this will add flavor to the frying, and as soon as the oil gets hot add the slices of pepperoni. Stire the content of the pan from time to time and add salt, salt is needed shortly after you insert the pepperoni into the pan, that way it will help get rid of the excess water.  As you see the pepperoni change their consistency add the vinegar and let the liquid dry out completely. Finally, add sugar two or three coffee spoons are enough, and let it caramelize for around five minutes. And there you have it a delicious way to prepare your beloved pepperoni",2020-05-30

**Prep time:**¬†30 minutes

**Cook time:**¬†8 minutes

**Servings:**¬†30 whoopie pies

**INGREDIENTS:**

***Butter Base:***

2 ¬Ω sticks (20 Tbsp) unsalted butter (at room temperature)

1 ¬æ cup sugar

1 ¬º tsp salt

2 tsp vanilla extract

2 eggs

***Dry Ingredients:***

325 g all-purpose flour (2 ¬Ω cups)

75 g cocoa (¬æ cup)

¬º tsp baking soda

2 tsp baking powder

***Filling:***

6 Oreo cookies

¬Ω stick (4 Tbsp) butter (at room temperature)

1 cup powdered sugar

1 tsp vanilla extract

4 oz mascarpone cheese or cream cheese

**COOKIE INSTRUCTIONS:**

Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F.

Combine the butter base ingredients. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or hand mixer), beat on medium speed for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture turns pale yellow and fluffy.

Combine and sift the dry ingredients. *Keep in mind the proper way to measure flour is to spoon it into the measuring cup and level off with a straight edge, else you might end up with too much flour and crumbly cookies. I recommend using a food scale to get more precise measurements.*

Add the dry ingredients to the butter base and mix on low until well-combined.

Using a cookie dough scoop, scoop 1-inch dough balls onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. *Make sure the dough are at least 2 inches apart because it will spread during baking.*

Bake for 8 ¬Ω minutes on the middle rack.

Press the cookies with the bottom of a glass gently as soon as they‚Äôre out of the oven.

*You must cool the cookies completely before assembling.*

**FILLING INSTRUCTIONS:**

Separate the cream from the Oreo cookies.

Combine the powdered sugar, butter, vanilla extract, and Oreo cream in a clean bowl. Using a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the mixture on low until everything is combined (to avoid powdered sugar bombs), then on medium high for 10 to 15 minutes until the buttercream turns very pale and almost doubles in volume.

Cut the cold mascarpone or cream cheese into 4 portions and add them into the buttercream one portion at a time while the mixer is moving. Continue beating until everything is combined. *This might seem a bit unconventional, but the cold cheese will solidify the butter just a little and allow the frosting to become extra fluffy.*

Crush the Oreo cookies into a fine crumble, and gently fold it into the buttercream with a spatula.

Make sure the cookies are completely at room temperature, then fill the buttercream into a 16-inch piping bag fitted with a Wilton 2A round tip. *Fit the piping bag over a tall glass first to prop it up if you‚Äôre doing this by yourself.* *Alternatively, you can use a freezer bag as the pastry bag: fill one side of the bag with the buttercream and make a quarter inch cut at the bottom corner.*

Flip half of the cookies up-side-down. Pipe a large dollop of buttercream on these cookies and sandwich it with the other half of the cookies.",2020-05-30

"recipe request: Mexican street food recipes with no weird ""Martha Stewart"" touch in them. Street food, basically.","Title says it.  My wife really digs Mexican food, but it seems like the top hits on Google always lead me to ""Oh, add a touch of Cr√®me Fra√Æche"" or other weird food-y stuff.  She just tends to like the regular stuff. For example,

* For a treat I made her tamales from scratch a few months back -- chicken slow roasted in adobo and stock, packed into masa, wrapped in corn and steamed.  We had more dough than stuff, so I made a few more using Oaxaca cheese and beans.

* We enjoy having our own refried beans.  They're just pinto beans simmered for a few hours with garlic and salt.  Mash and enjoy.

* I made ""Mexican"" toast the other day to use up some stuff we had in the fridge, so basically it was toast brushed with a mayo/egg mixture, re-toasted, and I dropped a spoonful of refried beans, cheese and a blorp of salsa.  It was pretty good.

OK so I just watched a video about making tortillas without a press. The lady just made dough balls and mushed the ball under a cutting board.  See, that's the kind of stuff we want, just plain stuff someone would have as leftovers, not a big fancy-pants dinner.",2020-05-30

Gluten-Free Sweet and Smoky Chipotle Barbecue Sauce Recipe,"This barbecue sauce recipe is really good.  If you are not gluten-free just use regular ketchup and regular Worcestershire sauce in the recipe.

Gluten-Free Sweet and Smoky Chipotle Barbecue Sauce Recipe

(Printable recipe link at the end of this post)

Barbecuing season is here and it‚Äôs time to dust off the grill and start cooking. This sweet and smoky barbecue sauce is flavored with chipotle chili powder, smoked paprika, brown sugar, and just a touch of apple cider vinegar that gives it a delicious, tangy taste. It‚Äôs perfect for barbecued ribs, barbecued chicken, or to use as a sauce for grilled hamburgers. 

Ingredients

1 cup gluten-free tomato ketchup (see notes)

1 15-oz can tomato sauce (substitute two 8-oz cans tomato sauce)

1/4 cup apple cider vinegar

1 TBSP gluten-free Worcestershire sauce (see notes)

1/4 cup brown sugar, firmly packed

1/4 tsp salt

1/2 tsp black pepper

1 tsp dried onion flakes

1/2 tsp granulated garlic (see notes)

3/4 tsp ground Chipotle Chili powder

3/4 tsp cayenne pepper

1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika

NOTES:

Ketchup usually has vinegar added to it to give it a tangy taste. If the vinegar is made from corn it will be gluten-free. If the vinegar is made from wheat those who are highly sensitive to gluten may have a reaction to residual gluten in the vinegar. For those who are highly sensitive always select a ketchup that is labeled as ‚Äògluten-free‚Äô.

At the time of this writing Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce was certified by the manufacturer as being gluten-free.

Granulated garlic is dried garlic that has been ground into fine granules. It has a gritty, sand-like texture and a mellow flavor. Do not use powdered garlic (which looks like flour) as the garlic flavor will be too intense. Do not use garlic salt (which has added salt) as the flavor will be too salty.

Cookware and Utensils

1-quart liquid measuring cup or bowl

Instructions

1. Add the ketchup, tomato sauce, apple cider vinegar, and the Worcestershire sauce to the measuring cup or bowl. Stir to combine.

2. Firmly pack the brown sugar into a measuring cup. Add the packed brown sugar to the ketchup mixture. Stir well to combine.

3. Add the salt, black pepper, dried onion flakes, granulated garlic, Chipotle Chili powder, cayenne pepper, and the smoked paprika to the ketchup mixture. Stir well to combine.

4. Cover the barbecue sauce with plastic wrap and transfer it to the refrigerator. Chill for 30 minutes before use to combine flavors. Refrigerate unused barbecue sauce.

Veggies Noodles with coriander omelette ribbons,"video recipe: [https://youtu.be/rO2uq8z5Raw](https://youtu.be/rO2uq8z5Raw)

I had a lot of coriander back home, so I needed to use it! Reading and thinking, I come up with this idea. I am quite pleased about the result, taste, easiness. It is undoubtedly an unusual dish! So,

WHAT‚ÄôS IN THERE?

FOR THE NOODLES

30 Mins time

250g of Noodles

Sunflower oil

1 Shallot

2 Carrots

1 Zucchini

1 Eggplant

A bit of dry, spicy pepper

Soya Sauce

Salt

FOR THE OMELETTE:

50g of coriander

3 eggs

Salt

COOKING STEPS:

Mince the coriander, cut the base and put it in the pan with the water.

Cut The carrots, eggplant and zucchini in stripes and cut the shallot.

Warm up the oil in a pan, stir fry the veggies, add spicy pepper, add soya sauce and cook them until they are done.

Meanwhile, boil the water for the noodles and cook them.

Also, whisk the egg with the coriander in a bowl and make an omelette in a pan, flip it, and cut it in stripes.

Join all together in the final dish and add a bit of fresh coriander!

LITTLE FUNNY FOOD FACT:

Did you know that most of the people perceive coriander as lemon/lime taste? Still, there is also a range between 3 and 21%, according to the ethnicity, that recognises it as soap taste! I find it extremely funny!

Well Done, by reading until here you just enhanced your Culture!",2020-05-31

Lettuce: How can I learn to like it?,"Hey all, 

I hope this is a good place for this question. I have always hated lettuce. I hate how slimy it feels and I hate the way it tastes. I've tried multiple times over to like it and I just can't. But I was recently diagnosed with PCOS, and it made me realize I need a diet change desperately. 

How can I learn to like lettuce? I want to keep trying in order to make this lifestyle change, but the pre-packaged salads haven't been the best starting point I guess. I'd also rather not use half a bottle of ranch to try to ""mask"" it. I don't know what to do or where to go. 

Is there a huge quality difference between pre-packaged and homemade? Does the type of lettuce factor into it as well?

Prawns were all the way through it, with the tails left on. There was some texture to the broth, like very small diced onion or garlic. The description of the dish (now no longer sold since the restaurant closed) was creamy tomato and rosemary broth. I don't recall it being creamy, but it's certainly not impossible. 

It was mildly spicy.

How To Make SUPER CRISPY Onion Rings !!,"This oven baked onion rings with breadcrumbs recipe is so crispy it will SHATTER in your mouth. Join me today to learn how to make onion rings in the oven and you will be rewarded with an addictively crunchy snack that is easy, healthy and low in calories. Once you learn how to make onion rings in the oven, you can kiss your deep fryer goodbye!

Full Video Recipe If You Would Like a Visual Guide: [https://youtu.be/jvTUyBxlZWg](https://youtu.be/jvTUyBxlZWg)

You will need:

&#x200B;

1 to 2 Medium Sized White or Yellow Onions

0.5 Cup + 2 Tbsp All-purpose Flour 

1/3 Cup Milk

2 Egg Whites

1.5 Cup Panko Bread Crumbs

1.5 Tsp Smoked Paprika

1.5 Tsp Chilli Powder

1.5 Tsp Garlic Powder

1.5 Tsp Onion Powder

1 Tsp Salt (to taste)

1 Tsp Black Pepper (freshly ground)

Nonstick Cooking Spray

&#x200B;

Steps: 

&#x200B;

1) Preheat the Oven to 200 degrees Celcius (or 392 degrees Fahrenheit).

&#x200B;

2) Take a medium-sized Ziploc bag and put 0.5 Cup of the All-purpose Flour and set aside.

&#x200B;

3) Take a sharp knife, and slice off the top and bottom of the Onion. Remove the papery skin and the first layer of the Onion. Start making thin slices of the Onion that are about 0.5 cm (0.2‚Äù) thick, and carefully separate the other rings from the inner rings. We will only be using the outer rings today (you may reserve the smaller rings for another meal).

&#x200B;

4) Place the Onion Rings into the Ziploc bag and seal the Ziploc bag. Give it a good shake and allow the flour to evenly coat the Onion Rings.

&#x200B;

5) Take a shallow bowl and put in the Panko Bread Crumbs, Onion Powder, Smoked Paprika, Garlic Power and Chilli Powder. Mix till evenly combined and set aside.

&#x200B;

6) Take 2 Eggs and separate the Egg Whites from the Egg Yolks.

&#x200B;

7) Take a bowl and put in 2 Tbsp of All-purpose Flour. Next add 1/3 Cup of Milk and the 2 Egg Whites, some Salt and Pepper, and whisk till fully incorporated into a uniform batter and set aside. Always remember to add the Flour before adding any wet ingredients as this prevents the Flour from clumping and makes the mixing process easier. 

&#x200B;

8) Neatly arrange your ingredients into an assembly line. Starting with the bag of Onion Rings on one end, followed by the batter, the Panko Bread Crumbs mixture and the baking tray.

&#x200B;

9) Next, taking 1 Onion Ring at a time, shake off the excess flour and dip the Onion Ring into the batter, making sure that the Onion Ring is evenly coated. 

&#x200B;

10) Drain off any excess batter and place the Onion Ring on one side of the bowl which contains the Panko Bread Crumbs mixture. Gently toss the mixture over the Onion Ring and allow the Panko Bread Crumbs mixture to naturally stick to the batter. Make sure you do not push down the Panko Bread Crumbs mixture over the Onion Ring as this will cause the Onion Rings to become soggy. Set the breaded Onion Ring onto the baking tray.

&#x200B;

10) Repeat Steps 8 and 9 with all the Onion Rings in the bag of Flour. You should be able to get 40 ‚Äì 50 Onion Rings from this recipe. When breading the Onion Rings in Step 9, a good tip would be to alternate the places where you place the Onion Rings when you bread them. This allows the Panko Bread Crumbs to stay dry.

&#x200B;

11) Once all the Onion Rings are ready on the baking tray. Give the Onion Rings a light and even coat of Non-stick Cooking Spray (this will allow the Onion Rings to brown and crisp up in the oven). 

&#x200B;

12) Place the baking tray into the oven for 12-15 minutes. After 10 minutes, I want you to stay close to the oven and do not walk away as the Onion Rings may burn very quickly. Once you see the Onion Rings start to form a nice brown colour, take the baking tray out of the oven. You can now cook any excess Onion Rings by repeating Step 12.

&#x200B;

13) Enjoy the crispiest oven-baked Onion Rings you have ever made!",2020-06-04

Hi,,2020-06-06
Chicken Nuggets - Salt Sugar Pickle Pepper Brined...,"Kind of threw this together today and it came out really good.

2 lb package of boneless chicken thighs

Cut thighs into nugget size then put in container or bag.

Brine: tbsp of salt, 3 tbsp of sugar, 2 cups of water. Warmed and stir until blended.

Pull of heat add 1/3 cup of pickled banana pepper juice and 1/3 cup of dill pickle juice. Few ice cubes to help it cool.

Add brine to chicken and refrigerate. Longer the better, but this worked well after 5 hours.

add enough oil to your cast iron skillet to fry these one side at a time. About 1/4 inch in my 8"" skillet. \*Remember that the oil level raises as you add pieces and it bubbles/spits. You want the right amount of oil. And a lid for your pan just in case it catches fire.

Set on medium and let come to temp. 350-375 deg is what I used.

Remove chicken from brine and pat dry. Whisk an egg, milk, and a tbs of hot sauce, coat chicken in mixture. Combine 1 cup of flour with tbs adobo and 1/2 tbs black pepper. Poor flour into bag, place chicken pieces in bag and shake until coated.

Place a few pieces of chicken into the skillet for a test fry. About 4-5 minutes per side or until they reach a nice crisp color and 160+ degrees. Then start adding more pieces as you feel comfortable. Too much at a time and the oil cools, so watch the temp and keep space between nuggets.

After pulling them out sprinkle with Chipolte pepper or your favorite spice. I find the seasoning is more noticeable sprinkled on right after leaving the oil. I also used a South Carolina Golden BBQ sauce tonight.

Don't see why this wouldn't work with white meat, but these were very tender and tasty. Will be doing it again.",2020-06-06

"I don't eat sweets,honey or any other sugar replacements.Are there desserts where the sweet taste comes from fruits that are easy to make?","Hi,like the title says i don't eat sweets.I know that many of you who try to cut sugar use honey or something similar.Knowing myself,if i use honey or maple leaf syrup i will overdo it and eat ton of it with everything and i don't want that.
So to maintain my diet,i think that using fruits is a good idea.So even high sugar fruits are fine.I know it is sugar,but at least it comes with other healthy things.
Are there some easy to make recipes where fruits act as sweeteners?It can be easy cakes,snacks or any kind of deserts for my sweet cravings.

Best Fried Chicken Burger in the World!,"Honestly until you eat this you will not believe how good it is. 

Also the simplest recipe in the world. 

Ingredients:   
Boneless & Filleted Chicken Thighs  
Mayonnaise  
Panko Breadcrumbs  
Salt + Pepper  
Olive Oil  
Buns & Condiments etc. 

Recipe:

1. Take chicken thighs and cut out the back part (The really fatty bit) and just use the larger front part (makes sense when you do it). 
2. Flatten very lightly. Just a light tenderising to make more of a flat burger shape, not flat like being driven over by an articulated lorry. 
3. Salt + Pepper Chicken and a separate bowl of Panko Breadcrumbs
4. Dip in full fat mayonnaise
5. Dip in Panko Breadcrumbs
6. Place in hot frying pan with small amount of oil and turn to lightly brown breadcrumb coating on both sides. (3-4 minutes on both sides - may be less depending on the size of your chicken thighs)
7. Once browned place in preheated oven at 200c for 10-12 minutes to finish off.

Enjoy the best chicken burger you will ever eat in your life! :)",2020-06-07

How can I cook/bake with oat milk? What recipes can you recommend that use or can be altered for oat milk?,"So I have been trying to cut back on dariy to see if that helps my baby be less fussy as I am breastfeeding. I can't do soy or almond milk, so I thought I would try oat milk. Oat are also supposed to help your breast milk supply so I figured it would be the best choice of non dairy milks. 

I found a carton of Silk plain oat milk on sale and bought it. I tried just drinking it and it's not bad but not great for straight drinking in my opinion. I tried it on some cereal and that was fine but I don't think I can use the whole thing before it goes bad on cereal. So now I have this carton to use but no experience with cooking with non dairy milk. 

How do other people use non dairy milk in general cooking? Is it a 1:1 swap? Or is it more complicated? Are there any good recipes that I can use it in? What are some recommendations for using it? Thank you in advance.",2020-06-08

Looking for a good sour candy or popsicle recipe?,"Let me start this off by saying I'm a BIG sour candy fan. I love sour candy so much, and the more sour, the better.

One thing I also love are the sour warheads popsicle, though I've never seen them in stores, and ice cream trucks only *sometimes* carry them.

Since I can't always go out and get my own sour candy, I figured I might as well make my own candy and popsicles. We bought all the ingredients listed on the warheads popsicle packaging - sugar, corn syrup, candy flavorings, malic acid, citric acid, guar gum, xanthan gum, basically everything on the label, and I'm figuring I can use a bunch of this stuff to help me make some candy as well.

However, I don't really know anything about making candy or popsicles. How much of these ingredients do I add? When do I add what? Why is this so confusing??

Every single recipe I can find for popsicles uses fruit, not sugar and flavoring. I don't want to make fruit popsicles, they won't be the same, but I don't know what the procedure is for making popsicles that use those and will be soft when you bite into them (I'm assuming with the use of gums). And every sour candy recipe is similar, in the end they just dip the candy in sour sugar and call it a day. What if I *want* the candies themselves to be sour, not just sour-coated?

Any help or direction would be appreciated!",2020-06-09

Does chicken absorb water?,"So the other day I was looking for recipes and I came across this one - Chinese pan fried pies

[Chinese pan fried pies](http://thewayriceshouldbe.blogspot.com/2016/01/xian-bing-chinese-pan-fried-meat-pies.html?m=1)

This recipe calls for beef and the chef has added water to the beef and stirred it till it was absorbed. 

Now I don't eat beef but I do eat chicken and I was wondering if the same can be done for chicken as well. So if I just substitute chicken for the beef and add water to it, then will it work the same? Will the chicken absorb the water too? 

This question might sound stupid or strange but I am an amateur cook and I don't have a lot of experience in cooking with meat so any help would be appreciated! Thanks! üòä",2020-06-10

Adding a swirl to ice cream?,"Ok I've done it!!!! I finally found the perfect (for me anyway) combination of milk/cream/sugar to make my own ice cream and it freezes perfect and remains creamy. It's great. However I'm not ready to add a blueberry swirl. But before I try, instead of going through a trial and error experience, I figured I'd ask you guys. I KNOW someone had the answer. 

I'm worried if I add the swirl to early in the churning process it won't be a swirl it will just turn the ice cream bluish purple. I'm afraid if I add it to late it might have the same effect. I was thinking maybe I should let the ice cream finish and then transfer it to the container and add the swirl slowly will mixing slowly and then freeze.  Or maybe someone here has a much better idea. Thanks in advance!!!!",2020-06-10

THE POTATO PIE!,"Watch the video here!

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN74n0DoLyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN74n0DoLyM) 

&#x200B;

Ingredients:

&#x200B;

\- 10 Medium potatoes

\- 500g Mozzarella cheese

\- 150g of smoked salami or normal salami your choice

\- 100g of Butter

\- Parmesan to your taste

\- Salt to your taste

\- Pepper to your taste

\- Prezzemolo to your taste 

\- Milk as described

\- Bread crumbs

&#x200B;

Recipe:

&#x200B;

Proceed by pealing all the potatoes and putting them in a pot full of water. Heat the pot until it's boiling and let the potato cook until they become very soft but not so much that they dissolve into the water.

In the meantime cut the salami and the mozzarella in small pieces.

Now take out your masher, if you don't have one don't despair you can simply use a fork to mash the potatoes and prepare a bowl where you need to put your mixture for the potato pie.

Add the potato to the bowl then start adding all the ingredients, Mozzarella, salami, butter in pieces, parmesan as you like (The more you put in the more flavor you get, but of course don't exceed).

Salt and paper and parsley (here the same as the parmesan).

Now you need to mix the ingredients inside the bowl and add the milk little by little as long as you keep mixing.

The milk is added to get everything softer, your mixture should be soft but not so much to result in a liquid mixture.

Preheat the oven.

As soon as the mixture is well stirred prepare a tall pan for the oven this way,

spread some bread crumbs throughout the pan, and add butter in little pieces. Add the mixture from the bowl and spread it consistently through the pan. 

Top everything again with beard crumbs and butter.

Cook in oven at 180 c  for around 40 min.

&#x200B;

Now your potato pie is ready! Make sure to let it sit or you will burn your tongue, hot potatoes are really hot!  ; P",2020-06-12

Tamale Pie - what do you like best?,"Tamale pie is unknown here in Australia and I‚Äôve never tried one, but it seems like it would make a delicious weeknight winter dish. 

Looking it up I‚Äôve seen a couple different versions. Some use  masa harina, which I can only get here via mail order, some use cornbread mix (again mail order). Some seem to top with unleavened cooked polenta/cornmeal/masa. Most have cornbread/masa as a topping but one had it as a base. 

A lot of them use convenience ingredients like jarred salsa or Rotel tomatoes which are not supermarket staples here, especially in a rural area. 

I‚Äôm looking for your favourite version and wondering how you serve it.  Do you put jalepenos and cheese in the toppinng, under the topping? How tomatoey is the meat base? How much vegetable? 

I have fineground polenta which would do for cornmeal in a cornbread-type topping. Plenty of cheddar, quite a few spices, including a few different dried whole chiles and plenty of cooking experience.  I know I could wing this on my own, but I‚Äôm looking for hints and tips or your favourite from-scratch recipe.",2020-06-13

Homemade Peanut Butter w/ 2 Ingredients!,"Hi r/recipes. I recently discovered that how easy it is to make your own peanut butter without all these added ingredients (sugar, HFCS, hydrogenated oil, palm oil, etc) . All it takes is peanuts and salt. I made a video of me blending a batch, whole process took 30 mins from start to finish, 15 of those minutes were idle too - waited for the peanuts to roast to my desired liking. Link to the video is below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciyI1roKldQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciyI1roKldQ)

If my calculations are correct, then this clocks in around 184 calories per serving (32 grams/2 Tablespoons). That's pretty comparable to regular store brand peanut butter (Skippy's, Jif, Etc) which clocks in at 190 calories for the same serving size.

Cost is similar as most raw peanuts I buy in bulk. Amazon sells 10lbs of cocktail peanuts at \~0.18 cents/ounce and salt is pretty damn cheap too. That being said, this procedure can work with any nut (almonds, cashews, etc) so you could probably make alt-nut buttters for much cheaper too!

Recipe is as follows:

Ingredients:

* Raw Peanuts (1-1/3 Cup)
* Salt (1/2 tsp)

Tools:

* Oven
* Food Processor
* Spatula

Directions:

* Roast the peanuts for 10 - 15 mins at 400F depending on how toasty you like it.
* Then toss the nuts into the processor and give it a few pulses.
* Stop and add the salt
* Now just start processing away till you get it to the consistency you like. Stop every once in awhile to scrape down the sides.

I like my PB a little thick and it took me 10 mins to get to that stage, but if you like it smoother, then you can keep going. Again the whole process from roasting to final product takes about 30 mins. You can also add in other stuff to flavor the PB if you want (Honey, Cocoa Powder, Cinnamon, etc) - I would add them towards the end, when you're just about done but not quite there.

If you want crunchy peanut butter, then roast an extra 1/3 cup of peanuts. Put that separate 1/3 cup of nuts in the processor and pulse 2 - 4 times or until you get pieces the size you like. Take those out, put in the 1-1/3 cup of peanuts, and follow the directions above. When you're just about done with the final processing, add those 1/3 cup of chopped peanuts back in and make sure they're well dispersed.

Let me know what you guys think, I'd love to get any feedback on recipe improvements or if you want to share what you made!",2020-06-13

I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me out - bonus points for a recipe with metric units, but definitely not necessary :)

Aside from the recipe itself - what do you think is the part that can *make or break* the gumbo? E.g. specific ingredients or preparation steps, etc.

Just a little reminder: if the recipe uses a seasoning blend, I will probably have to substitute it somehow or make it myself since I can't just buy it here.

TOFFEE RECIPE NOT WORKING WRONG TEXTURE PLEASE HELP,"My toffee comes out bendy but snappy on the edges, definitely to hard to cut properly with a knife. It's hard on the outside and chewy on the inside, which makes for a really bizarre mouthfeel. I want a totally soft and chewy toffee that cuts easily!

This is the second time this happens with the recipe I was given from culinary school, I'm not enjoying it particularly... I would like to switch to [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0xAz9K3gMQ&t=196s) recipe but it calls for double cream which isn't available in my country. According to google, British double has a fat content of 48%, mine only has 35%. I could reduce it, but considering cream also has other stuff, I would not know how much I should have to boil it exactly, it's not as easy as reducing it to half it's volume (although it's called double cream). Perhaps I should add more butter?

My current recipe is this one:

\-200g Sugar

\-160g Glucose Syrup

\-40g Water

\-270g Cream

\-28g Butter

\-28g Honey

\-Vanille (to taste)-Salt (to taste)

Instructions:

\-Heat in a sauce pan the cream, butter, honey, vanille and salt. Bring to a boil, reserve.

\-Prepare a wet caramel with the sugar, glucose and water until it reaches 145¬∞C (or 296¬∞F)

\-Add the pre-heated cream mixture to the caramel while stirring

\-Cook until it reaches 116¬∞C (or 240¬∞F)

\-Pour over mold, let cool at room temperature before cutting

I should also mentioned that I just figured out that my candy thermometer is off by -2¬∞C, I doubt that could be the thing that's ruining the texture, but I thought I should mention it.

Is there anything wrong with my recipe? Or perhaps I'm failing at the execution?  


UPDATE: turns out I just made hard candy apparently. Now that it cooled completely, I went to the kitchen to check it's texture and I accidentally dropped it, it shattered... Must've gone to high with the temperature? ",2020-06-14

Best chili paste for making epic chinese fried rice,"Hi all,

I'm sure you are aware of how great the Chinese fried rice tastes when you order it at a restaurant (well most of them atleast).  It's usually bright red in color due to chilies, and has an awesome smell and taste.  Like this:  https://imgur.com/vsgSpUl 

Does anyone know what paste is usually used?  If you have some recommendations, please let me know!

I've already tried a couple of pastes from Amazon:

\-Momoya Chili Oil with Fried Garlic Taberu Layu

\-Lee Kum Kee Chiu Chow Chili Oil

I mean these are decent, but no way as good as restaurant level fried rice.

Please help me achieve my dream of making restaurant level spicy fried rice :)

One Pot Garlic Parmesan Pasta,"I make this when I babysit my auntie's kids. They love it.

**Yields: 4 Servings**

**Ingredients:**

* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

* 4 cloves garlic, minced

* 2 cups chicken broth

* 1 cup milk, or more, as needed

* 8 ounces uncooked fettuccine

* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

* 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

* Optional parsley garnish


**Instructions:**

1. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the garlic in and cook it until it's fragrant, which should be 1-2 minutes.

2. Stir in chicken broth, milk and fettuccine; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

3. Bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring it occasionally, until pasta is cooked through, about 18-20 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan. If the mixture is too thick, add more milk as needed until you think it's thin enough.

4. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.



**Notes:**

- If you decide to double the recipe, don't double the garlic. Do 1.5 times the original, so 6 cloves.",2020-06-19

Grilled Mushroom and Onion Pizza For Summer!,"Had an amazing summer recipe last night (forgot to take a picture oops) but it was so easy!  

You need: 

1/2 yellow onion

1 cup mushrooms

1 cup frozen spinach (thawed) 

Trader Joe's herb garlic dough

olive oil

, just caramelized some onions then chopped up mushrooms and spinach, threw it on the TJ's garlic and herb dough and grilled it out on the mini grill with olive oil.

"Cacio e Pepe | $0.87 per serving, only 3 ingredients, 10 minutes total time","###Edit: I am removing bucatini as an option as it does not cook well using this skillet method, it needs more time and water than spaghetti. I am also making 1/2 teaspoon salt mandatory in the pasta water. 

&nbsp;

This is a classic Roman pasta dish called Cacio e Pepe. You may be familiar with this already. This is probably the most delicious thing you can make with this number of ingredients. The name translates to cheese and pepper, and that's all you really need to know! This is so easy and delicious, I've been eating it every day for lunch this week and I have no regrets.

### **Required special equipment:** 

* A box grater with those fine star teeth that nobody ever uses

* Digital kitchen scale

* Pepper mill

* 12"" non-stick pan


---

&nbsp;

### **Notes:**

**This recipe is for one portion**. You can easily scale this up, as needed. This uses an easy to remember 1:2 ratio of cheese to pasta, by weight. Volume measurements will not work here because of how finely we are grating the cheese.

100g (just shy of 4 ounces) of pasta is enough for one hungry adult. That means for every 100g of pasta, you need 50g of cheese. If you want to make this for four adults, that would be 400g of pasta and 200g of cheese, for example. Metric measurements really do make this simple, this is why I am calling the scale required equipment! Most (all?) digital kitchen scales have the ability to switch between ounces and grams, sometimes they hide a switch on the underside of the scale. 

One note on scaling, because we are cooking the pasta in a 12"" skillet, you may have to cook it more traditionally if you are scaling it up a lot. I have not tested the upper limits of how much I can fit into a 12"" skillet, but I am guessing about 300g of pasta would be the max. If you need to cook more than that, just cook the pasta traditionally and reserve at least 1/4 cup of the pasta water for later. 

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

### **Ingredients:**

* 50g Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated
* 100g spaghetti
* ¬Ω teaspoon salt
* ¬Ω teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

&nbsp;

### **Prep (mise en place)**: 

* Using the fine star teeth side of the box grater, grate 50g of cheese (per serving). It is easiest to do the grating within a half or [quarter sheet pan](https://i.imgur.com/nFYXmFa.jpg). Then transfer into a heat-proof bowl. 

* Take a damp kitchen towel, twirl it into a rope like you're going to whip somebody, then wrap it into [a circle the size of the base of your bowl](https://i.imgur.com/7B23QIL.jpg). Then [nestle your bowl with cheese into the towel-ring](https://i.imgur.com/AAu5Qrw.jpg). This will keep the bowl stable when you are whisking boiling water into the cheese later on. You can skip this step if you are using a sturdy bowl. 

&nbsp;

### **Instructions:**

1. [Add dry pasta into cold 12"" non-stick skillet](https://i.imgur.com/5F3wXoi.jpg) (You can see here I am making a 1.5x batch).


2. [Add enough water to fully cover the pasta in the skillet](https://i.imgur.com/uG3VFul.jpg). Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt (do not scale this amount up).

3. [Bring the pasta to a boil over high heat](https://i.imgur.com/Bb8xTS2.jpg), set a timer for the cook time as noted on the box of your pasta. Stir the pasta frequently during this time. Note that our goal is to not strain any water at the end, we are looking for just a small amount of water remaining in the skillet when the pasta is fully cooked.

4. While the pasta is boiling, crack approximately [1/2 teaspoon black pepper (per serving) into cheese and toss to incorporate](https://i.imgur.com/nbImnfZ.jpg). It is not necessary to measure the pepper, but you can if you wish. 

5. When ***2 minutes remain*** on the timer, ladle in small amounts of pasta water into the cheese while whisking at the same time. Keep doing this until the [cheese is the consistency of a smooth and thick paste](https://i.imgur.com/5ALyJ2w.jpg). 

6. Keep a close eye on the level of water remaining in the skillet. By this time, [there should be more pasta than water](https://i.imgur.com/YWrnwsj.jpg), and the pasta should be perfectly cooked. No more than 1/4 cup of water should remain.

 \*  If the pan is *dry* before the pasta has finished cooking completely, add 1/4 cup of water at a time until the pasta finishes cooking. 
 
 \* If the pasta has finished cooking and too much water remains, reserve 1/4 cup of pasta water and strain the rest out and move the pasta back into the skillet. 

7. Off heat, transfer all of the cheese mixture into the pasta with the remaining water. Do not drain the water, it is very important to leave approximately 1/4 cup of pasta water in the skillet. If you reserved any pasta water, add it back to the skillet now. 

8. Mix the cheese into the pasta & water with a rubber spatula and continue mixing off heat until [well combined and creamy](https://i.imgur.com/pM7dyfG.jpg). Garnish with more black pepper and cheese if you wish. Enjoy!

### **Cost Breakdown:**

| Ingredients | Ounces | Cost/oz. | Total Cost |
|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| Pecorino romano | 1.76 | 0.406  | $0.72 |
| Spaghetti | 3.53 | 0.044  | $0.15 |
| Black pepper | --| --| --|


&nbsp;

Total cost per serving: **$0.87**

&nbsp;

Note: These costs are from my local Costco and they represent the cheapest possible option. In comparison to prices for each ingredient from my local grocery store, the total cost of everything is **$2.23 per serving**.

That's a pretty significant savings! Pecorino Romano is pretty cheap at Costco, not so cheap at my local grocery store.

Recipe: [https://homemadeonawhim.blogspot.com/2020/06/soup-dumplings.html](https://homemadeonawhim.blogspot.com/2020/06/soup-dumplings.html)

**Prep time:** 2 hours

**Cook time:**¬†8 minutes  

**Servings:**¬†45 dumplings

**INGREDIENTS:**

***Gelatin Broth:***

250g pork skin

750g water

2 envelopes unflavored gelatin powder (optional) 

***Filling:***

215g lean ground pork

85g fatty ground pork

1 ¬Ω Tbsp soy sauce

¬Ω Tbsp Shaoxing wine

2 tsp sugar

¬Ω tsp salt

¬Ω tsp MSG

¬Ω tsp ginger powder

¬Ω tsp onion powder

‚Öõ tsp white pepper

250g homemade gelatin broth

***Wrappers:***

300g bread flour

¬Ω tsp salt

160g water

**GELATIN BROTH INSTRUCTIONS:**

Scald the pork skin in a quart of boiling water for 2 minutes, then rinse with cold water. Trim any fat off the skin, scrape both sides clean, and cut into 1-inch squares. Discard the water.

Place the pork skin cubes and 750g fresh water into a blender and blend on smoothie setting until the mixture achieves a creamy consistency. Transfer this mixture into a small nonstick pot and simmer on low with the lid on for 45 minutes.

Allow the broth to cool to room temperature, then strain it through a large fine mesh strainer into a container. Press down the bits caught by the strainer with a spatula to get the most liquid out. Discard anything that‚Äôs left in the strainer and store the broth in the fridge for at least 2 hours, until it sets like jello. *If you didn‚Äôt use enough pork skin and the stock isn‚Äôt firmly set, or if you‚Äôre new to folding soup dumplings, add 2 packets of flavorless gelatin powder to the broth after you strain it, stir until well combined, and let it set in the fridge.*

**WRAPPER INSTRUCTIONS:**

Add the salt to the bread flour and mix well. *You can use all-purpose flour here, but keep in mind the dough will be less sturdy and the dumplings will have a higher chance of leaking when steamed.*

Slowly pour the water over the flour mixture while mixing with a non-stick spatula until clumps form and very little powdery flour is visible.

Knead the dough with your hand until a smooth consistency is reached, for about 5 minutes.

Roll the dough into a ball, cover with cling wrap, and let it rest for 25 minutes in room temperature.

**FILLING INSTRUCTIONS:**

Combine all the filling ingredients except the gelatin broth and mix with a spatula in one direction for 5 minutes, until the proteins from the ground pork are released and the mixture becomes sticky to itself.

Roughly chop the 250g gelatin broth (after it‚Äôs set) into quarter inch cubes, add them to the rest of the filling, and mix until well-incorporated. Place the filling in the freezer for 25 minutes.

**ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS:**

Punch a hole at the center of the dough ball, and slowly stretch the dough out from all sides, working the dough into a large donut shape. Break the dough at one spot and continue working it into a rope.  

Divide the dough into 10g portions, roll it into a tiny ball, and press down with your palm to form a small flat circle. Dust with extra flour as needed to prevent sticking.

If you‚Äôre right-handed, work the rolling pin with your right hand and turn the small circle with your left hand after each roll. This way the wrapper has a slight cone shape and is thin along the edges. Finished wrappers should be 4 inches in diameter. For a visual guide, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltfMi1feSUs).¬†

*As with all dumplings, it‚Äôs nice if you have a helper so that one person can roll out the wrappers and another person can wrap. If you don‚Äôt have that luxury, be sure to cover any dough you‚Äôre not working on with cling wrap to prevent it from drying out. As a shortcut, you can skip the above assembly instructions all together, use a pasta maker to press the dough into a one-sixteenth-inch thin sheet, and cut using a cookie cutter 4 inches in diameter; however, just keep in mind the edges will be thicker than the hand-rolled version and you‚Äôll end up with more dough at the top of your soup dumplings.*

To fold the dumplings, hold a wrapper (cone facing up) with your left hand and spread approximately 2 teaspoons of filling into a 2-inch circle at the center of the wrapper. *It seems counterintuitive but spread-out filling is easier to wrap. To better portion the filling, I used a 1 ¬º inch cookie-dough scoop with spring release and spread the filling out with the bottom of the scoop.*

As you‚Äôre folding each dumpling, push the underside of the wrapper with your left index finger to create the fold, then use your right thumb and index finger to pinch the folds together. As you pinch, lift your left ring and middle finger to rotate the dumpling clockwise, so by the time you‚Äôre done the dumpling should‚Äôve made a 360 degree turn in your left hand. *I prefer to close the eye at the end so that soup won‚Äôt escape from the top. but it‚Äôs up to you.* For a visual guide, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R98LqTH00ys). 

With water in the steamer already boiling, steam the dumplings for 6 minutes on medium heat, then turn off the heat let them rest for 2 minutes with the lid still on. *Do not steam on high, as you risk popping the dumplings as the steam inside expands.*

Once steamed, these dumplings cannot be stored and must be consumed right away; however, you can freeze the uncooked ones for up to two weeks in the freezer. I like to dust a disposable mini-cupcakes container with some flour and place a dumpling in each spot. Since they‚Äôre frozen, you‚Äôll need to steam them for 10 minutes on medium heat, and rest for 2 minutes with the lid on before serving.",2020-06-20

* Finely chop the florets and put it in the vessel filled with buttermilk water
* *Repeat The Process For All The Florets In Petals*...
* keep on removing the outer cover. at one stage, the florets will be so small that do not need to remove the stamen (they will be very tender) and hence chop it as such

If you had one recipe to impart with your dying breath what would it be??,"Hi I'm looking for exceptional recipes that you can't recommend highly enough.
My favourite is a butternut squash salad that i feel everyone should know about... great with bbq, or as an accompaniment to roast chicken, steaks or grilled fish.  It's a show stopper that never fails to please and I never seem to grow tired of.  (Credit goes to Irish singer Lisa Hannigan, the recipe is not my own)

INGREDIENTS
1 butternut squash
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
A good pinch of cayenne
1 tablespoon olive oil
Big handful of puy lentils, rinsed
A big bowl of baby spinach and rocket
Half a packet of feta, crumbled
A small handful of pumpkin seeds

DRESSING
1 shallot chopped finely
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
Handful of fresh mint, chopped finely
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon mustard
1/2 teaspoon sugar
Salt, pepper

METHOD
Preheat oven to 200 degrees C. Halve and peel the butternut squash, scoop out the seeds and chop into inch-sized chunks. In a roasting tray, toss the squash with the cumin, paprika, cayenne and oil. Roast in oven for about 45 minutes, taking them out half way through to mix about a bit
While that‚Äôs cooking, cover the lentils in water and boil for 20-25 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
Whisk all the dressing ingredients together and set aside.
In a big serving dish, mix the salad leaves, the lentils, the crumbled feta, the warm roasted squash and toss in the dressing. Garnish with a sprinkling of pumpkin seeds

My partner loves baklava but is allergic to pistachios. Substitute nut suggestions? (in addition to walnuts),"Baklava, as you know, traditionally has pistachios.

Asian Fusion: Pierogi Potstickers,"Hi all, this recipe was originally born of my laziness (didn't feel like making the pierogi dough) but my fiance and I ended up liking them better than the original so now we make them like this all the time. We make these in big batches and freeze them so we always have a tasty app or side ready to go!  This is my first time sharing a recipe here, hope you like it!

&#x200B;

Makes: \~50 pierogi potstickers

&#x200B;

Ingredients:

\- 50 premade round dumpling wrappers (1 pack)

\- 1.5 lbs russet potatoes

\- 1 cup freshly grated cheddar cheese

\- 2 tbsp cream cheese

\- 2 tbsp salted butter

\- Garlic powder

\- Salt & pepper

\- Vegetable oil

&#x200B;

To Prepare:

1. Begin bringing a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. While the water warms, wash peel, and cube your potatoes. Boil the potatoes in the water for 20-30 minutes until they are  cooked through (a sharp knife stabbed into a piece should pull out cleanly).
2. While the potatoes boil, shred your cheese from the block (skip if using shredded cheese, but its much better off the block!)
3. When the potatoes are cooked through drain them and return them to the large pot. Add the butter and cream cheese and mash until smooth, then add the cheese and continue mashing until everything is evenly combined. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. (I recommend being heavy handed on the salt!) It is important that you taste the mixture as you go!
4. Allow the filling mixture to cool to room temp, or transfer it to the fridge to cool. You don't want it to be too hot when you start filling your dumplings.
5. Place 2 teaspoons (\~1 scant tablespoon) of filling in the center of a wrapper and fold using preferred dumpling fold. I recommend the 2nd technique described [here](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/3-folding-techniques-to-make-dumplings-at-home-for-chinese-new-year-article). If you have never folded dumplings before please read that before starting. You will want a small bowl of water to dip your fingers in to wet the edges of the wrapper to help it seal. (if you're having trouble google ""how to fold dumplings""). Note, I use a cookie scoop to fill mine which works great.

To Freeze:

1. To freeze the pierogi you need to place them in the freezer such that they are not touching for at least 15 minutes. This allows the surface of the wrapper to freeze. Once this is complete you can transfer them to a zip bag for long term storage. If you skip this step your pierogi will freeze together and be ruined. I place mine on a cookie sheet as I make them and then stick the whole sheet in the freezer.

To Cook:

1. Starting with frozen or room temp pierogi (I actually recommend starting from frozen, it helps them hold their shape) heat 1.5 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat in a large skillet with a lid. Once the oil is hot add \~10 pierogi and fry on all sides until golden and crispy, add more oil if needed. Once crispy, add ¬Ω cup of hot water and cover with the lid (be very careful, the oil/water may splatter). Steam for 3 minutes, then remove the lid and continue cooking until all of the water is gone. Transfer to a plate and serve immediately. Do not overcrowd the skillet, work in batches if making a lot at once.
2. Serve with a side of sour cream. These make a great app or a hearty side (we love these with a good garlic butter steak) Enjoy!

Dragon boat festival is approaching, many Asian are celebrate this day with not only boat racing but also making the traditional rice wrapped meat stuffing dish that is call Zongzi. Typically we uses the sticky rice to make the outer layer and dip it with spicy sauces or sweet and sour sauce. In some region they like to eat it with sweet so would dip in condense milk or sugar.

This year we are inspired to make a different type of Zongzi, so we replaced sticky rice with mochi dough and the result did came out pretty well, the texture was very sticky and chewy, very flavorful mixing with the pork stuffing that is inside. It was complimented really well with the sriracha sauce mixed with sugar and hot water.

Below is a full recipe on how to make it step by step, I also have made a video instruction on this, check out the video if you would like to follow it: [https://youtu.be/9fR5YFXYhJQ](https://youtu.be/9fR5YFXYhJQ)

"Every week I cook a Middle Eastern recipe, this week I made Lahmacun flatbreads that are eaten throughout the Turkey and the Levant","## What is Lahmacun  

Flatbreads exist in all Middle Eastern cuisines from Moroccan Msemen to Iranian taftoon, every country has their unique flat breads, but one that is shared widely across borders is Lahmacun. Pronounced Lah-ma-june, these meat topped flatbreads are a quintessential staple in Turkey, the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine) and Armenia. Apart from Lahmacun there are many other types of topped flatbreads such as Manakish, Pide and Moajanat which are sometimes topped with Cheese, Zaatar or spinach. The name Lahmacun applies to flat breads topped with a mixture of Lamb, Peppers, Onion and Tomatoes. The vegetables and meat are minced really finely and thoroughly mixed to create a smooth topping that is spread over the dough. This turkish recipe includes Red Pepper Paste and Pul Biber (Aleppo Chilli) which results in a delicious Smokey and Umami flavour not far from that of smoked Paprika. The flatbreads are usually baked very thin in a wood oven, then served with fresh Parsley, Onions and Lemon. The result is a suprisingly light and refreshing bread that could work as an snack, or main dish.  

[Here's how mine turned out](https://imgur.com/a/MQBILIb)

^(This dish is sometimes refered to as Turkish Pizza, though they share very few characteristics other than both being flat and both containing tomatoes. In the Levant Lahmacun is called Lahm B'Ajeen and in Armenia it's commonly called Lamadjo)  

## Flavor Profile  

The main flavours in this are the Lamb, Red Pepper paste, Fresh Vegetables and Aleppo Chilli. The Lahmacun on their own have a meaty flavour that is elevated by the fresh vegetables and parsley, when freshly baked they have the additional delightful flavour of freshly baked pitta bread. Once topped with Onions, Parsley and a squeeze of Lemon then wrapped the lahmacun are instantly elevated with a fresh herbyness and kick of zest. I make the onions with Sumac which adds another layer of citrussy flavour to the Lahmacun wraps.  

## History  

Although this recipe is Turkish, the origin of Lahmacun is not well known, luckily a clue lies in the name. Lahmacun, is thought to come from the words Lahm Ajeen which means Meat Dough in Arabic. In fact the version of Lahmacun eaten throughout the levant is called Lahm B'Ajeen (Meat with Dough) and despite the recipes being a little different you would be forgiven for thinking they were the same if placed side by side. Indeed a single line recipe for Lahm B'Ajeen is written in ""Scents and Flavours"" a 13th Century Cook book from Aleppo in Modern Day Syria. In the 1960s the dish gained popularity in Turkey and spread all over the country. Now you can find it served in nearly all Turkish Restaurants throughout the world as an appetizer or snack.  

## Ingredients:  
For 8 25cm (10in) Lahmacun

### Dough:  
500G (1lb) All Purpose Flour  
375 ml (12.6 fl oz) Whole Milk Room Temperature  
6 Tbsp Vegetable Oil  
1.5 Tsp Instant Yeast  
1.5 Tsp Salt  
  
### Meat topping:  
375G Lamb Mince
2 Plum Tomatoes  
1/2 Brown Onion  
1/2 Green Pepper  
1/2 Red Pepper  
1 Green Chilli  
3 Cloves of Garlic  
Bunch of Parsley  
75g (3.2 oz) Red Pepper Paste  
50g (1/6 oz)Tomato Paste  
1 Tbsp Pul Biber or Allepo Chilli  
1 Tsp salt  
30ml (1 fl oz) Vegetable oil  
  
### To garnish:  
Large bunch of Parsley  
1 Red Onion  
1/2 Tsp Salt  
1 Tsp Sumac  
2-4 Lemons  
Any salad vegetables you like

## Directions:  

### To make the Dough:  
Pour your milk into a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment  
Add the instant yeast and mix briefly to combine  
Add the AP flour and salt then mix to combine until a dough ball forms  
When all the milk is absorbed into the dough turn the mixer speed to high and knead  for 5-8 minutes until the dough pulls away from the walls of the mixer bowl and has a tacky texture (sticks and leaves a little residue but is springy)  
Add 1 tbsp of the oil to your dough at a time and work it in, this is easiest done by hand. Once absorbed repeat until all the oil is used  
Grease a bowl with some vegetable oil and pour out the dough into it  
Let it rest for 30-60 minutes until doubled in size  
  
### To make the Topping:  
Roughly chop and prepare the following; 1/2 a brown onion, 1/2 a green pepper, 1/2 a red pepper, 2 plum tomatoes, 1 green chilli and 3 cloves of garlic  
Add them all to a food processor or blender and then add in a bunch of parsley as well as 1 Tsp salt, 30ml vegetable oil, 1 tbsp Pul Biber, 50g Tomato Paste and 75g Red Pepper Paste  
Process until a fine paste forms, taste for seasoning and ensure it is over salted  
Add your meat to the food processor and Process till well combined with the vegetables  

### To make the Cured Sumac Onion garnish:  
Thinly slice a whole red onion and place in a bowl  
Add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and mix well to work into the onions  
Add 1 teaspoon of sumac and mix to combine  
Set aside for 15-30 minutes so the onions can cure   

### To Cook:  
Pour your dough out onto a well flowered work surface and divide into 8 equal sized pieces  
Roll a piece of dough out as thin as you can get it, you should use a non stick pan this size (make sure it has metal handles)  
Place your dough onto a non stick surface and then add a few tablespoons of the topping  
Spread the topping out into a thin even layer, spread it all the way to the edges  
When ready to cook, heat your non stick pan on medium high heat and preheat the grill on your oven  
Fold your lahmacun in half and transfer it into the pan, unfold the lahmacun in the Pan and re-distribute any topping which has moved  
Let it cook for 2-3 minutes until the underside is just starting to brown and the topping starts to bubble slightly  
Place the pan under your grill for 3-4 minutes until the topping is dry and well browned  
Remove the pan and place back on the stove until the underside of the Lahmacun is evenly browned  
When cooked, stack the lahmacun one on top of the other on a plate. This will help them remoisturise and will soften the dough  

### To serve:  
Place a lahmacun on a plate and top with a handful of fresh parsley  
Add some of the Cured Sumac Onions   
Squeeze on the juice of 1/4 - 1/2 a lemon  
Roll up the Lahmacun into a wrap and enjoy  

## Notes:
* Yes I know Turkey is not always considered part of the Geographic Middle East, but culinary it can be considered such. This is because the former Ottoman empire which controlled the Middle East for centuries spread cuisine throughout the region.  
* Lahmacun is usually served very very thin. I've seen it served at restaurants the thickness of spring roll wrappers but I was unable to work it this thin. If you can I recommend doing it and cooking for less time. I have also seen them served slightly thicker the same way I made them, but the majority are thin.  
* If you have a pizza oven or a pizza stone then you should try baking one in the oven straight away, it will cook fully in just a couple of minutes I think.",2020-06-24

Good YouTube channels for new bakers,"Now I'll be the first to admit I'm not the best baker but I am a pretty good cook so I know cooking lingo, techniques, etc that when I bake it turns out pretty good. My boyfriend on the other hand has little to no cooking background and has recently picked up baking!

Most of what he makes has been ok or even very good! But sometimes he messes a recipe up because he misunderstands instructions or takes them too literally. Now I don't want to discourage him and I feel bad if I stand over him as I want him to explore his hobby on his own, but we almost had a (super) burned sugar cream pie the other day because he felt he had to cook the mixture the full 8 minutes on a boil! The recipe said bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer, 7-8 minutes or until thickened. Now I understand his misunderstanding but yeah. 

So anyways I'm happy to help if he asks and he always asks for recipes so I figured I should find a good YouTube channel that's got decent recipes and also explains concepts like why we reduce to a simmer, or when to stop cooking something that is thick despite the recommended times or whatever! Just a good channel that provides building blocks and teaches techniques as well as good recipes!

So far the ones I have found are for kids, expect some sort of knowledge, or are not general recipe videos but just technique videos(which are fine but I think he would enjoy learning while baking something more). Any channels you would recommend?",2020-06-24

Slow cooked beef/chicken/turkey all have to be ground and I am running out of ideas to make stuff versatile and tasty for him, especially as we avoid adding salt and sugar to his diet. Anyway, I was eating store bought salmon pate and he was so eager to taste it and try little pieces of bread with it. It dawned on me that I might want to diversify the offer and make some homemade pate, as store bought has too much stuff added to it. Any ideas and recipes will be greatly appreciated!",2020-06-24

The best Mac n cheese recipe ever,"It‚Äôs my own recipe, and you‚Äôll love it.

8oz of pasta of your choice (I prefer elbow)

6tbs of butter 

2cups of whole milk

3tbs of all purpose flour 

About 1/2 - 1 tsp of cayenne pepper powder

About 1/2 tsp of salt 

About 1/4 tsp of black pepper

About 3 tsp - 1 tbs of garlic powder

1 8oz block of sharp white cheddar cheese

1 8oz block of mild cheddar cheese 

1 8oz block of mozzarella cheese 

8 oz of parmesan cheese

1 cups of breadcrumbs

Some extra cheese 





Instructions:

1: boil the pasta

2: grate your cheeses (grating cheese tastes so much better than using bagged cheese, it melts better too.)

3:while the pasta is boiling, in a large pot melt 3tbs of the butter. Once the butter is melted, add the 2 cups of milk. After adding the milk, add the flour and stir vigorously with a whist or wooden spoon until a roux forms. (You could add the flour and combine with the butter before the milk, that‚Äôs what I used to do, but then one day when I was making it, I added the milk first by mistake, and it is much faster to add the milk first) 

4: turn off the heat as add in all the seasoning and mix until fully combined.

5: add in all of your cheeses and fold them in (if the cheese won‚Äôt melt, turn the heat back on low until the cheese melts)

6: fold in your pasta

7:add the Mac n cheese in an 8 inch square cake pan.

8: melt the remaining 3 tbs of butter. 

9: add shredded cheese in the breadcrumbs and mix

10: add the melted butter in the breadcrumbs and cheese and mix. Put the breadcrumb mixture on top of the Mac n cheese and spread it out so that the Mac n cheese is completely covered

11: put the Mac n cheese in the oven at 370 degrees. Bake until the bread crumbs are golden brown, about 15-20 minutes. 

12: take out of the oven and enjoy!",2020-06-25

Recipe: [https://homemadeonawhim.blogspot.com/2020/06/shrimp-pad-thai.html](https://homemadeonawhim.blogspot.com/2020/06/shrimp-pad-thai.html)

**Prep time:**¬†30 minutes

**Cook time:**¬†15 minutes

**Servings:**¬†2

**INGREDIENTS:**

***Basic Ingredients:***

6 oz dried rice sticks

1 ¬Ω Tbsp vegetable oil, divided

2 stalks spring onion

2 eggs

***Shrimp Marinade:***

8oz large shrimp (peeled and deveined)

2 tsp baking soda

¬Ω cup ice water

***Sauce:***

2 Tbsp palm sugar (or brown sugar)

2 Tbsp fish sauce

1 tsp tamarind concentrate

2 tsp sriracha

2 tsp peanut butter

2 Tbsp water

***Garnish:***

4 oz mung bean sprouts

2 Tbsp crushed roasted peanuts

Lime wedges

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. *I used Asian Best brand size M rice sticks for this recipe.*

Marinate the shrimp with baking soda and ice water. Drain, rinse thoroughly, and pat-dry with paper towel before use.

Wash and divide the spring onion by the white and green portions and cut both portions into one-inch segments.

Combine all the sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix. *It‚Äôs okay if the peanut butter is lumpy. If you‚Äôre not using sriracha, substitute with ¬Ω tsp additional tamarind concentrate.*

Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a non-stick 12-inch skillet and toss in the white portions of the spring onion, cook on medium-high heat for a few minutes, until a little bit of caramelization occurs.

Add the shrimp to the skillet and sear both sides until the shrimp are three-quarters done, for about 2 minutes. Add ¬Ω tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the shrimp and toss for 30 seconds, then remove everything from the skillet and set them aside in a plate.

Drain the rice sticks and place them in the same skillet. Pour in the remaining sauce mixture. Toss the noodles so that they‚Äôre evenly covered with the sauce, then reduce the heat to low and continue to stir for 5 minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed. *Taste-test a noodle at this point, if it‚Äôs still hard, add 2 tablespoons of water and cook until the liquid is absorbed again, repeat this process until the noodles soften.*

Bring the heat back to medium-high and push the noodles to one side of the skillet, add ¬Ω tablespoon of oil to the other side, and crack in two eggs there. Wait until the egg whites turn white, then scramble the eggs with the spatula. Once the eggs are cooked, toss with the noodles to combine.

Toss in the green portions of the spring onion, *and the mung bean sprouts if you don‚Äôt like them raw and crunchy.* Cook for 30 seconds, then turn off the heat.

1 tablespoon tomato paste  

Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

1 pound pasta

  
  

**Directions**  

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pan over medium heat.

If using butter put it in to melt an stir in just before serving  

Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Drain and serve topped with the sauce.  


**Notes**
 
May 19, 2020. - Initial recipe construction. I made this from three different recipes, taking the best of all three and with an eye on not having to run to the store for herbs if I didn‚Äôt want to or can‚Äôt without getting COVID-19ed to death. All of this text is WITHOUT having made this yet.

Here‚Äôs my thoughts before I‚Äôve made this for the first time. Two of the recipes call for a 15oz can of tomato whatever, which will result in a thicker sauce, but also add water. (¬º cup mostly). I am using the 28oz can of tomato whatever, because that‚Äôs what I usually have in the house. If you want it thicker, use the smaller can.  Whatever floats your boat. 

A couple notes on spices and herbs. Apparently there are regional variations of this, some without allspice, some with, some without mint, some with. Some without cloves, some with. They all have cinnamon. These spices are a heated topic about what is ‚Äúauthentic.‚Äù I‚Äôm not Greek, and while I want authenticity, I‚Äôm not married to it. So for this first iteration of this recipe I‚Äôm going for maximal spices. If it's too much or whatever, I‚Äôll cut it back or eliminate a spice. The only spice I think is a must-have for authenticity is the cinnamon. I‚Äôve also included the dried and fresh version of some of the herbs, so this can be a pantry-raid kind of meal without having to go to the grocery store for fresh mint or parsley. 


**RESULTS**

Okay I made this a few days later. Its not a bad recipe, I think it turned out the way it was supposed to. The flavors were good, the sauce had a good consistency. Here‚Äôs the thing:  Neither of us think it was that special. The spices were not too strong, but honestly, it wasn‚Äôt better than regular Italian spaghetti sauce. I imagine if you grew up with something like this, you may be over the moon with it. For us, it was good but not worth making again.

**Query**

Anybody else make something like this? I don't think there is anything wrong with the recipe, its just ....meh. I was trying to meld it a bit for authenticity.  I don't have any pics of the result....plus it just looks like red sauce on spag.  Comments on recipe construction welcome!",2020-06-25

Steak with Butternut Squash Polenta,"Ingredients **for 4 portions**

21oz / 600g steaks (tenderloin, ribeye, sirloin or similar cut)

12oz / 350g frozen butternut squash pur√©e

3cups / 700ml whole milk

3.5oz / 100g cornmeal or dry polenta

2.8oz / 80g onion (1 small piece)

3tbsp / 45g butter

2.5oz / 60g grated parmesan

0.5tsp salt

0.25tsp pepper

&#x200B;

Instructions:

1. Cut onion into dice (1/4 inch / 5mm).
2. Season steaks with half of the salt on both sides and half of the pepper on one side only.
3. Melt butter in a pan over medium-high heat, add onions and saut√© for 2-3 minutes until they become translucent.
4. Add frozen butternut squash pur√©e, milk, remaining salt and pepper, mix well and bring to a boil.
5. While butternut-milk mixture is heating up, put oil in a second  pan and set on medium/high heat. Once the oil is hot (usually takes 1-2  minutes) put the steaks in with the salt-only side down and cook for 3  minutes (set a timer).
6. Once the butternut-milk mixture boils, reduce the heat to medium  and slowly pour in cornmeal/polenta in a thin stream while whisking  constantly. If necessary, slightly adjust the cornmeal amount to get the  best consistency. Add parmesan. Continue to cook for about 2-3 minutes  until the polenta is smooth, keep stirring. Turn off heat once done, but  continue stirring occasionally until steak is ready to avoid film from  forming.
7. After 3 minutes on one side, turn steaks and cook for another 4  minutes on the other side. After that time a 1-inch (2.5cm) steak will  be medium-rare. For rare cook only 2 and 3 minutes, for medium cook 4  and 5 minutes and for well done cook 5 and 6 minutes. If the steaks are  thinner or thicker add/subtract about half a minute for each ¬º inch (1/2  cm).
8. Serve steak together with polenta.

Turkish Delight Recipes?,"Hello! So I have no idea if this is the right place to ask this, but I figured I'd give it a shot.

I've been really into candy making recently and the one thing I would love to learn about is different variations of Turkish delight/Lokum.

Well, I'm referring to it as that because it's what I'm most familiar with, but I've heard that it's also sold in different countries sometimes under different names? I'm wondering what kind of variations can be found between countries or just different takes on Turkish delight in general that I could learn about. 

I would love to try out different recipes for this and experiment. If anybody has any recipes or advice I would be extremely grateful! Thanks in advance.",2020-06-26

Super fast and easy French Dip,"A french dip sandwich is a very straightforward old school sandwich that I had never considered making at home until this week.  If you ask the chefs on YouTube, they'll show you how to roast a giant chunk of beef and bake your own rolls.  I, and presumably you, am not interested in doing that.  I can offer you a sandwich that's at least 90% as good as the all day effort version, takes just a few minutes, and only dirties one pan.

**Ingredients**

* 1-2 pounds (most of a kg) of the best roast beef your local deli counter sells, sliced thin
* 1 large onion chopped into small pieces with butter or oil to saute. 
* Sliced Provolone cheese
* 4 large crusty rolls or 2 small loaves of bread halved
* 1 tsp (5 mL) Better than Bouillon - Roasted beef flavor 
* 8 oz (250 mL) hot water
* Salt/Pepper/dry herbs/creamy horseradish sauce/literally anything you can think of

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 350F.  That's like the ""once upon a time"" of recipes.
2. At my grocery store, they sell loaves of bread that still need 10 minutes of baking to finish.  If you can't find those, buy rolls or any bread with a nice crusty outside.  Put them on a cookie sheet in the oven for a few minutes until the middle is hot.
3. Heat butter or oil in a large skillet or saute pan.  Add onion and salt.  Cook over medium heat to soften or higher heat to add some color.
4. Add roast beef and provolone to skillet.
5. When cheese is melted and meat is warm, transfer to bread.  
6. Mixing the water and bouillon listed will give you about what a restaurant would serve 4 people.  Adjust the volume and intensity as desired.",2020-06-27

Dill Pickles: to ferment or not to ferment?,"Hello friends,

I planted some Kirby cucumbers in my garden this year and they're producing a lot. I'm planning on pickling most of them, and then doing a hot water canning so I can try to preserve them for a couple months. I've pickled stuff before (mostly onions and ramp bulbs), but have never tried to make traditional dill cucumber pickles. Now, a lot of recipes I've looking at online seem to be divided into two camps: to do a traditional vinegar pickle like I've done before, or to ferment the cucumbers for several days in a brine with spices. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? What tastes better? I don't mind fermenting the cucumbers, but I'm afraid I don't have adequate temperature control. Thanks for any help or tips you can provide!",2020-06-28
Self made Dutch Kibbeling (fried cod fish) with fried sweet potatoes,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:**  

*Kibbeling:*  

300 grams cod fish  

1 egg yolk  

100 gr flour  

150 ml milk  

(olive)oil  

fish herbs (I used dille, dragon, salt, pepper, but you can use any herbs you like with your fish)  

*Sweet potato fries:*  

sweet potato  
2 egg whites  
herbs (I used chili, sweet pepper, salt, pepper)  

*side:*  

romaine salad  
tomatoes  
cucumber

Prep:  
Heat the oven to 200 C.  
Make slices of the sweet potatoes into fries. Marinate with the herbs and egg whites.

Put down a baking paper on the oven rack. Put the marinated fries on the rack.  
Pay attention that they all have enough space. It takes approximately 40-50 minutes to make. I make intervals of 20 mins to take them out and turn them.

In the meantime we start with the fish. Make little blocks of the cod fish, marinate with the herbs and set aside.

 Wash the salad and other vegetables you like to put in, cut it and put it together. 

 While we make the batter, you can heat the oil.  

The batter: 
mix the egg yolk with the flour and some fish herbs. Then add a little milk at a time and mix it all until it is good mixed together. At last put the fish in the batter and mix it. 

TIP: 
you can check if the oil is hot enough by sprinkling it with water from your fingers. The temperature is good when it makes a sizzling sound when the water touches the oil.  
Make around 4 batches of the cod fish to fry it for 5 minutes per batch.When the batch is finished, pay attention that the oil should be warmed up first before you put a new one in. Otherwise the fish will soak up all the oil.

When the Kibbeling and the fries are ready, we finish making the salad with a dressing. I put salt and pepper, parmesan, and a little bit of balsamic vinegar and oil. A traditional and tasty dressing :)

And in the end it looks like in the picture!",2020-06-28

"Homemade Bean Dip - A Cool, Refreshing Accompaniment to Chips","Hi r/recipes. Made some bean dip the other day inspired by hummus recipes and wanted to share it with you guys! Recipe and video of me making it is below:

[https://youtu.be/Pm9FunS7JB8](https://youtu.be/Pm9FunS7JB8)

**Ingredients:**

* 2 Cans of Beans, drained
* 2 Medium Carrots
* 3 Cloves of Garlic
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Sesame Oil
* 2 Tbsp Peanut Butter
* 1 Tbsp Lemon Juice
* Dash of water (if needed)

This is more of a baseline recipe than anything else. You can sub the red beans for any beans, swap carrots for other root veg (or take em out entirely), use other flavored oils, acids etc. There's no rules here, whatever floats your boat. Sesame oil can get kinda pricey, but a little bit of it goes A LONG way - again though, feel free to use whatever oil instead (garlic flavored oil could be pretty good - just saying).

Let me know how this goes for you all! I'd love to see/hear back on any new creations you guys do to the ingredients above.",2020-06-28

‚Ä¢ burger buns

‚Ä¢ sauce of choice

‚Ä¢ cheese of choice

Directions:
‚Ä¢ Cut a medium onion in half lengthwise and then cut one half horizontally into thin semicircles and store other half for later. Cut this half too if you're making 2 burgers.

‚Ä¢ Toast buns

‚Ä¢ Place the onion slices on a cast iron skillet in a pile and place beef patty on top.

‚Ä¢ let it cook for a few minutes until onions are cooked and the beef has browned then flip.

‚Ä¢ let beef brown on the other side then cover with cheese slice (I prefer cheddar).

‚Ä¢ Turn off the heat and cover until the cheese has melted.

‚Ä¢ get your toasted bun, place your patty and onions on it, spread sauce of choice on the top bun (eg: burger sauce or bbq sauce) and place top bun.

Optionally you can add pickles if you want. Also you can skip out on the sauce since you're getting a lot of flavour from the onions anyways, but it adds a nice touch to the burger.",2020-06-29

   2. Add the dried fruit.
   3. Pour the cheesecake batter on top.
4. Put it in the oven at 325¬∞ for 60 to 70 minutes. Once done, you should be able to put a toothpick in it and pull it out cleanly.
5. Chill in the fridge for at least an hour. If you eat it straight out of the oven, it'll seem very loose.

DILL GALORE,"Ok, I love dill, and i buy it pretty much weekly, but as y‚Äôall know, there are two options for buying herbs at the store - a giant bunch you could never use in a week unless preparing for a ton of people, or the tiny plastic containers that don‚Äôt get you anywhere - and often cost more than the former. So I always buy the big bunch.

I eat salmon at least 2 x a week, and use dill in an Alison Roman inspired whole lemon dressing that I put on the fish and a spinach salad, I‚Äôve tried home pickling, and I use it in simple salads w cucumber, tomato, lemon juice, s&p - delicious.

But any outside the box ideas on what to do with dill?",2020-06-29

Quick filled pizza,"Hey there! I found this in one of my mom‚Äôs cookbook, just did it, and it‚Äôs delicious.

INGREDIENTS

Dough:
2 cups of flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 tsp pepper
1 tsp baking powder
70 g of butter (I used 10 tsp)
2 yolks
1/2 cup of milk

FILLING:
1 finely chopped onion
1/2 cup of oil
Oregano
2 tomato‚Äôs
Salt and pepper 
Cheese

DIRECTIONS

DOUGH:
Sift together the flour, salt, pepper and baking powder. Then add the yolks, and gradually add the milk to create a dough, but not working it. Let it rest for half an hour, covered, in a fresh spot. 
Separate the dough in half; roll the first half in a well-floured surface until it‚Äôs 3-4 mm and put it into a baking sheet previously buttered. 

FILLING:
Fry the onion, oregano and half the oil; let it rest. When cold, add to the dough that‚Äôs in the baking sheet. Then add a layer of tomato slices, and add on top some salt, pepper and oregano. Put then a layer of cheese, and add on top the rest of the oil. 

Roll the second half about the same size as the first one, and cover the fillings. Then with a fork stick both doughs by the borders. You can ‚Äúpaint‚Äù the top dough with some of the whites left. Put in the oven for half an hour and it‚Äôs done! 

You can add other filling if you like. I added some spinach :)

Nut Bar from Pret a Manger 2000s,"Hey all!

Growing up my dad would occasionally bring me these square shaped nut sweets from Pret a Manger when he travelled to the US and they were my absolute favorite sweet as a kid. Last time he found them was late 2000s, and we never figured out what they were. I thought of them till i had those Whole Foods date and walnut cakes (called matitas I think). It‚Äôs similar in size and texture but not so much in the taste. My dad says all he remembers is that he used to find them by the cashier, so I‚Äôm assuming it was just a little treat that pret sold for a few years.

Anyways, because of COVID I‚Äôve been home with my parents and I really wanted to figure out what those were so I could make them and have it with them. I‚Äôve looked all over the internet but since I have no clue what they‚Äôre called it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint what exactly to look for. Not sure if anyone remembers the name and/or having them. I know this isnt a lot to go from but I was hoping to find some sort of guidance so I can finally figure out what those where and make it for them.

I have a great memory of making borscht with ggma so I decided I'm going to make borscht today to honor her. Unfortunately I swear that when we made it together years and years ago she used rhubarb and I can't find any recipes online that use rhubarb. I can't ask any relatives for the recipe because it's a mutual disowning thing. Does anyone have a recipe for borscht that uses rhubarb? I would be super greatful,2020-06-30

Hot Chorizo Chili,"**Ingredients**


* 1 onion, diced
* 1 green pepper, diced
* 1 lb ground hot chorizo
* 1 lb lean ground burger (beef or turkey)
* 1 & 1/2 tsp minced garlic
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 1/4 tsp cayenne (double this if you substitute out the hot chorizo)
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 Tbs chili powder
* 1 large can (28 Oz) whole tomatoes, with juice
* 1 can (16 Oz) kidney beans, drained (you can double this if you want)
* 1 cup water


**Directions**


1. In the bottom of a large pot, saute onion in oil until translucent
2. Add ground chorizo and burger, pepper, & minced garlic
3. Cook until meat is done, then drain grease
4. Return drained ingredients to the pot, adding the spices, water, beans, and tomatoes. Be sure to break up tomatoes in the pot
5. Cover and simmer for 1 hour

**Notes**

* I personally prefer turkey to beef, but most people would likely use ground beef
* This recipe is a bit spicy, and I've played with it until I got it just right for my taste (I previously used 1/2 teaspoon cayenne and hot chorizo which definitely had me sweating a bit)
* I don't like too many beans in my chili but the original recipe calls for 2 cans if that's up your alley
* You can skip saut√©ing the onion if you want to, but I like to do that first because I feel that it really brings out the flavor of the onion

"Every week I cook a Middle Eastern recipe, this week I made Fattoush; a tangy and refreshing garden salad from Lebanon","## What is Fattoush + Intro to lebanese cuisine  

Lebanese cuisine is probably the most well-known cuisine from the Middle East. Lebanese restaurants exist in countries all over the globe, this is partly due to  the large number of Lebanese people living abroad (4 million in Lebanon vs 8-14 in the diaspora), but also the similarities Lebanese cuisine shares with some European cuisines (Mezze or Mezza being similar to Tapas, and the flavour profiles not being too foreign). The most common style of eating Lebanese food is usually as a spread of Mezze or small plates. These are usually divided up into hot and cold Mezze, for hot it's common to see Grilled Halloumi, Chicken Liver with Pomegranate, Stuffed Vine Leaves, Batata Harra as well as many others. For cold Mezze you commonly see Houmous, Labneh and Moutabal but also two crucial cornerstones of Lebanese cuisine; Fattoush and Tabouleh. 

Fattoush and Tabouleh are both cold salads that you can find in every Lebanese restaurant and I don't think a visit is complete without ordering at least one of them. Tabouleh is an extremely fine chopped salad made with bulgur, parsley, cucumber, tomatoes and onions. Today we are tackling Fattoush which is the polar opposite of Tabouleh, it is a chunky salad that although contains mostly the same ingredients, it tastes very different. One component that Fattoush has over Tabouleh is crispy fried bread that is added in to give a final crunch.  

[Here's how mine turned out](https://imgur.com/a/lt3q78v). If you prefer video recipes, the link is in my post history.  

## Flavor Profile:  

Fattoush is a very refreshing salad, the salad contains a number of cooling vegetables such as Cucumber and Lettuce  along with Mint and Parsley to give it a herbal kick. The dressing is sweet and tart owing to the Pomegranate Molasses, Lemon and White vinegar in it. The texture of Fattoush is really crisp, owing to the fresh cucumber and lettuce that is added in. The fried bread adds a great textural crunch that is very satisfying. Overall the dish is the perfect kind of salad for a hot summer day.  

## History:  

I couldn't find much about the history of Fattoush, but what I can tell you about is Fatta (plural Fattat) which the name is thought to come from. Fatta dishes are a classification of dishes in the Middle East that are made using crisped old bread. It is thought that the dishes came about as a way to prevent the wasting of day old bread. Fattat are mainly a Levantine food and there are quite a few different dishes such as Fattet Humus, Fattet Betengan or Makdous (Aubergine), Fattet Farakh (chicken Fatta) and also Egyptian Fatta (Rice with bread and meat stock). Fattoush is considered to be part of the Fatta family although the only similarity it has is the crispy bread.  

## Notes and tips:  
* Fattoush is all about being a chunky salad, precise measurements aren't necessary but err on the side of things being a bit chunky. At the same time you want to be able to get all the components onto your fork at the same time so don't make it too chunky  
* The dressing makes enough for the salad, but you might not need it all, taste and adjust the amount as necessary  
* The correct bread to use here is Lebanese flatbread which is paper thin. If you cannot get this you can use Pitta but the texture will be quite different. The bread is traditionally fried, but if you are making it with Pitta I recommend baking the bread as it Pitta can absorb a lot of oil in comparison to Lebanese Bread. Use either bread, not both  
* The bread should be crispy in the salad, so add it to the salad right before serving. If you make the baked pitta it is thicker and so you can add it a short while before serving if you would like it to soften up a bit. You don't want the bread to be rock hard either  
* Just getting ahead of people saying Fattoush is also from other countries. Yes it is also consumed in other places, that's what you get when empires break down into smaller countries. It is however widely regarded as a Lebanese dish  

## Ingredients:  

Makes 1 Family sized (6-8 servings) Fattoush  

### Salad Ingredients:  
1-2 Pitta or 1-2 [Lebanese bread](https://egyptianplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1490410319-1024x683.jpg)  
6 cups chopped lettuce or 1 Whole Romaine Lettuce  
3 cups chopped cucumber or 3 small middle eastern cucumbers or 1 large English cucumber (Highly recommend getting these small cucumbers as they are less watery and more flavourful than the large ones)  
1.5 cups chopped tomatoes or 8 small plum tomatoes or 3-4 large plum tomatoes  
1/2 cup chopped radishes or 6-8 radishes (french or garden work great)  
1/2 cup chopped spring onion or 3-4 Spring onions  
2 tbsp chopped mint or Small handful  
2 tbsp chopped parsley or Small handful  

### Dressing:  
50ml (3 tbsp) Olive Oil  
45g (3 tbsp) Pomegranate Molasses. Check if yours has added sugar, if not increase by another tbsp and consider adding a tbsp or two of sugar to the final dressing  
3 tsp sumac  
1 clove garlic  
Juice of 1 lemon  
Zest of 1/4 lemon  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp dried mint  
1/8 tsp pepper  
1 tsp white vinegar  

### To decorate:  
1-2 Tbsp Pomegranate Molasses  
3-6 Tbsp Pomegranate seeds  
Hanful of mint leaves  


## Directions:  

### To bake the Pitta:  
Microwave your pitta for 10-20 seconds till it softens and is bendable   
With your hand ontop of the pitta, slide your knife between the two layers and work it around the outside to separate them  
Cut into pieces about 1.5cm or 1/2"" width and length  
Place on an oven tray and top with 1 Tbsp olive oil per pitta  
Season with salt and pepper then mix to combine  
Bake in an oven preheated to 180c or 350f for 8-12 minutes until golden  

### To fry Lebanese bread:  
Cut into pieces about 1.5cm or 1/2"" width and length  
Heat some oil in a frying pan, test it by adding a single piece of bread and if it floats and fries add a handful of bread  
Fry for 20-30 seconds until it just starts to brown (only cook it till it just browns ever so slightly as it will continue to darken and fry when you remove it from the oil)  
Remove the bread from the pan and let it drain on a kitchen towel lined plate  
Season with salt and pepper while still hot  

### To prepare the salad:  
Take off the root of your lettuce and separate the individual leaves, wash them thoroughly  
Stack a few similar sized leaves on a chopping board, and trim the leaves to a rectangular shape  
Chop the lettuce into strips about 1cm or 1/4"" wide, cut any trimmed edges to size too (you don't need to worry about the length of the strips for the lettuce)  
Chop the ends off of your cucumbers and then split in half  
Cut the cucumber halves into pieces 3mm or 1/8"" thick  
For the radishes, remove the tops and tails then slice about half the width of the cucumbers  
For the spring onions trim off the roots and cut into rounds the same thickness as the cucumber  
For the tomatoes cut them in half and then divide each half into quarters (If you aren't using baby plum tomatoes then cut them till each piece is almost 5mm or 1/4 inch wide and long)  
Wash your parsley thoroughly then chop the parsley into thin ribbons (Include the green parts of the stem but not the woodier bottom parts)  
Remove the stalks from your mint and chop the leaves into thin ribbons  

### To prepare the dressing:  
Place your sumac in a small bowl and top with 3 tsp of hot but not boiling water  
Leave it to sit and rehydrate for 15-30 minutes  
Add your olive oil to a blender or a small jug  
Zest a 1/4 of a lemon and add to your jug  
Mince or grate 1 clove of garlic into a fine paste and add to your olive oil  
Juice the lemon and add 2 tbsp of its juice to the dressing  
Add the sumac from earlier along with any of its liquid  
Add 1 tsp of white vinegar  
Season the dressing with the mint, salt and pepper  
Blend the dressing together to emulsify  
Taste for seasoning ensure it is tangy but still a little sweet  

### To assemble the salad:  
Mix all the vegetable ingredients and herbs together (lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, radishes, spring onion, mint, parsley)  
Pour on half of your dressing and mix  
Taste and add more dressing if it isn't well coated  
Just before serving top with your toasted or fried bread (if the toasted bread is really dry you can mix it with some dressing to soften it further, it should still be crispy though not soggy)  
Add on a few tablespoons of pomegranate seeds, some mint leaves and drizzle over some pomegranate Molasses  

### To decorate:  
Toss some whole mint leaves over the salad, you can give them a whack to bring out the mint flavour even more  
Add a few tablespoons of Pomegranate seeds to the salad, I really like this as it adds another texture to the dish  
Drizzle some pomegranate molasses over the top of the salad",2020-07-02

Old Bay Deviled Eggs,"&#x200B;

Recipe: [https://homemadeonawhim.blogspot.com/2020/07/old-bay-deviled-eggs.html](https://homemadeonawhim.blogspot.com/2020/07/old-bay-deviled-eggs.html)

*While classic deviled eggs recipes call for paprika, Old Bay is in fact a more flavorful substitute because it contains not only paprika, but a handful of other spices such as bay leaves, celery seeds, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. If you can plan ahead, buy the eggs two weeks in advance and store them in the fridge before use, as older eggs are easier to peel. This recipe is super simple but will be a perfect addition to your summer picnics.*

**Prep time:**¬†10 minutes

**Cook time**: 20 minutes

**Servings:**¬†1 dozen

**INGREDIENTS:**

6 eggs

2 ¬Ω Tbsp mayonnaise

¬Ω tsp yellow mustard

¬º tsp black pepper

¬º tsp old bay

4 bread and butter chips pickle slices

1 Tbsp bread and butter chips pickle-juice

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

To make the hard-boiled eggs, fill a pot with a quart of cold water and gently place the eggs in the pot. Set the heat to medium and bring the water to a boil, in about 5 minutes. Once the water is boiling, let it boil for 15 more minutes. Be sure the eggs are always submerged. *Starting with cold water might take longer but prevents the eggs from cracking.*

Rinse the cooked eggs in cold water, crack the shells, and peel them gently under cold running water.

Slice the eggs lengthwise. *Pay attention to any dark spot on the eggs: it happens when the yolk is too close to the edge. Do not cut there because you might end up tearing the egg whites.*

Gently remove the egg yolks and place them in a mixing bowl. Set the whites aside in a serving tray or container.

Break apart the egg yolks with a large folk. Add the mayonnaise, yellow mustard, black pepper, and old bay, and mix until well-combined.

Chop the pickles into one-eighth inch dices. Add the pickles and the pickle juice to the yolk mixture and mix until creamy.

Disperse the yolk mixture back into the egg whites with a butter knife.

*For prettier presentation, fill the yolk mixture into a 16-inch piping bag fitted with a Wilton 4B open star tip, and pipe the yolk mixture onto the egg whites: start at the center, apply pressure in a burst, and lift. This might seem like a hassle, but if you‚Äôre making multiple batches it‚Äôs a lot easier than dispersing with a butter knife.*

Sprinkle with additional Old Bay and serve.",2020-07-02

Sesame Balls / Jian Dui (Gluten-Free and Vegan-Friendly),"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bxcrdyt0og851.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcb89d119472a4afd40e65a0dc1c105d26749de8

**Recipe Page: https://vegantheway.com/sesame-balls/**

### Ingredients

* 372 grams glutinous rice flour (Approximately 3 1/4 cups)
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 3/4 cup brown sugar (I used light brown sugar)
* 1 1/4 cup hot water
* 1/2 cup red bean paste
* 1/2 cup white sesame seeds (Not toasted)

### Instructions

* Start by adding the brown sugar to the hot water. Mix the two until the brown sugar has dissolved into the water.
* Next, add your glutinous rice flour and baking powder to a bowl. Mix and create a well in the middle. Pour the sugar water into the well in the glutinous rice flour and then slowly mix the liquid outward into the flour to create your dough. Mix until the dough is well combined and no longer sticking to the bowl, this will take 3-5 minutes. It was easier for me to use my hands toward the end. Add slightly more water or glutinous rice flour as needed.¬†
* Next, lightly dust a cutting board or a different surface with the glutinous rice flour. Knead the dough for up to 5 minutes or until you have a smooth and slightly glossy dough mixture.
* Next, divide the dough into 25-30 balls. Flatten the balls with your hands until they are around 1/2 inch thick. I find the dough was still crumbly when I first start working with it, but it will warm and become sticky to the heat of your hand.¬†
* Then add 1 tsp of red bean paste to the center of the disk and wrap the dough around the red bean paste. Crimp the edges to ensure they are sealed and then roll and toss the ball between your hands to smooth the outside.¬†
* Once you have made the balls you‚Äôll roll them in the sesame seeds. If the seeds are not sticking to your balls then get your hands slightly damp with cold water and roll the balls in your hands so the outside becomes slightly wet. This will help the sesame seeds stick to the balls.
* I rolled out all my sesame balls at once. When you get toward the end of your batch turn on the stove and heat your oil to 350 degrees F. You will want the oil to be deep enough to submerge the sesame balls when they first go into the oil.
* Once your oil is up to the correct temperature add 4-5 balls depending on the size of your pot. The balls will expand as they fry, so plan accordingly when adding the sesame balls.¬†
* The balls will sink to the bottom when they are first frying, make sure to stir them so they don‚Äôt rest and cook on the bottom of the pot. You‚Äôll cook these for 10-15 minutes. Make sure to stir the sesame balls occasionally so they cook evenly. They will become golden brown when they are ready.
* Remove the balls from the oil, and place on a wire rack or paper towel lined plate to cool. I would recommend blotting off the excess oil before cooling on a wire rack since these were quite oily.
* Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or with a light fry in oil or an air fryer. These can also be frozen for up to a month. Reheat frozen ones in an oven or air fryer for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.¬†",2020-07-02

My own Mediterranean Tuna Salad Recipe,"Hi all, 
This is my own tuna salad recipe. You can put in a baguette or croissant or eat it as is. I call it a northern Mediterranean tuna salad to distinguish from the southern Mediterranean tuna salad, which is also known as the Tunisian tuna salad, or the Israeli tuna salad, depending who you ask. 

Ingredients: 
1 can tuna salad in olive oil 
1-2 hard boil egg
Green onion aka chives 
1 Mediterranean pickle 
5-10 green olives 
2-3 garlic cloves
Dill weed
Pepper 
Coriander (optional) 
1/2 cup squeezed lemon 
2 table spoons olive oil 
Avocado (optional) 

Don‚Äôt add any salt. The tuna, pickle and olives are already very salty. Adding salt would make it way too salty to the point of unbearable. 

This is hands down the best tuna salad variant you can make, and it‚Äôs good for you and is completely healthy. Usually tuna salad is made with mayo, which contains lots of fat. Tuna is a high protein, low fat, low carb option so if you‚Äôre on a diet this is the best salad you can get. No mayo, no fatty sauces, no sugar, no croutons. It taste way better, it‚Äôs way healthier and it‚Äôs much more satisfying than Cesar salad, Greek salad and your regular mayo tuna salad.",2020-07-02

Authentic bruschetta,"Hi,

I've eaten tons of bruschetta so far but have all been made differently. I wanted to create a recipe for myself and stick to it, but doing research online has made me a little confused.

I'm attempting to use up ingredients I have to save money and I also want to have new meal staples. It sounds good or is it blasphemous? I haven't had anything like it and Google just yields macaroni topped with potato skins.

I also have celiac disease so gluten free foods cook up differently. My gf macaroni is pretty good and husband can't tell a difference. The only thing is gf pasta always has a film after boiling. So the one pot thing will turn into two.

'Healthier' alternative to cured meats for egg scramble?,"I make a kind of egg scramble with cured meat, cheese and veggies every single day (for gains). I've heard online that eating cured meat often (like I do every day) is bad for you due to the nitrates in it, which can increase the risk of cancer. Now I wonder what might be a better alternative for an egg scramble for which I basically use the same ingredients as a frittata, but instead of putting it in the oven I first fry the meat and veggies and then add the beaten eggs & cheese and scramble it together in the pan. 



I use cured meat because I know that a frittata is also usually made from it and I try to stick to that, also the meat (I usually choose chorizo as it's the cheapest where I live) has fat which once rendered I fry the veggies in. Also the salt is nice to season everything. 



Now I'm not even sure if eating the cured meats that often is even that big of a deal (I only add 30 grams of cured meat), and if it is, does anyone know a meat that can offer good fat content and great flavor for this specific instance? Thanks",2020-07-05

10 Mins Garlic Butter Shrimp,"This version of butter garlic shrimps has an extra oommph in flavours, all thanks to the addition of fish sauce!

Don‚Äôt be surprised if you thought you tasted something similar like this during your trip in Vietnam!

The seafood shops in beach cities in the South like Nha Trang, Vung Tau, Mui Ne etc always have this on their menus, and you can choose this style of cooking for crabs, all types of snails, clams or shrimps.

However, although named as ‚Äúb∆°‚Äù in Vietnamese, aka butter, they often use margarine. Just choose the one that you prefer!

&#x200B;

**INGREDIENTS: (2 servings)**

‚Ä¢ 15 medium shrimps, deveined. (You can leave shells and heads on for more flavours!)

‚Ä¢ 2-3 tbs of unsalted butter/margarine

‚Ä¢ 2.5 tbs of fish sauce, 2.5 tbs of sugar (adjust to taste as different brands give different level of saltiness)

‚Ä¢ 1 bulb of garlic, 2 sprigs of spring onions (or adjust the amount as you like)

‚Ä¢ A loaf of baguette/your preferred bread

‚Ä¢ Salt, chili flakes to taste

**STEPS:**

‚Ä¢ Finely mince garlic & white part of spring onions

‚Ä¢ Finely chop green part of spring onion (for garnishing)

‚Ä¢ Heat butter/margarine in a pan under medium heat

‚Ä¢ Add shrimps, sprinkle a little bit of salt and fry for 1 minute

‚Ä¢ Add minced garlic and white part of onion and continue cooking until they are cooked

‚Ä¢ Add fish sauce and sugar, keep stirring to thicken the sauce

‚Ä¢ Remember to adjust to taste, so that it has good balance of saltiness and sweetness

‚Ä¢ Lastly add chopped green part of onion and remove from heat.

‚Ä¢ Serve hot, sprinkle chili flakes to taste.

‚Ä¢ Best eaten with toasted thick baguette slices. Enjoy mopping up that awesome sauce!

Resources/Websites for Authentic Recipes,"I‚Äôm always interested in cooking foods from regions outside of traditional American influence, especially Latin and Oriental dishes. Although googling can help to find ideas and recipes, it seems like most of the ones I find are hardly authentic, and seem like a modern amalgamation to the American palette.
Are there any websites, books, or other resources that focus on authentic recipes of foreign foods? TIA",2020-07-07

Homemade Rasgulla. Bengal's most famous sweetdish," **Recipe:** [Link Here](https://youtu.be/Bf0_Ht-Xxzg)

**Disclaimer:** Rasgulla preparation needs a certain degree of expertise. While it is still easy to prepare at home, I would suggest that you follow the instructions and the ingredients given in recipe link as much as possible. Happy cooking

**Ingredients (Serves 5-6 persons):**

* 1.5 ltrs Cow Milk
* 2-4 tbsp Lemon/Lime juice
* Maida (White refined Flour)
* Cardamom
* Baking Powder
* Sugar
* Drinking Water

**Instructions:**

* Squeeze a lemon to extract 2-4 tbsp lemon/lime juice.
* Heat 1.5 ltrs cow milk till it starts boiling. Add 2-4 tbsp lemon/lime juice GRADUALLY WITH CONSTANT STIRRING IN LOW FLAME till milk starts curdling and whey is seperated from chenna (cottage cheese)
* Take a strainer and a light cotton cloth to strain out the whey water. Rinse the chenna with cold water. Again strain out the water by squeezing the cloth. Tie the cloth with chenna inside and hang it for 1-2 hours in a manner that water drops out of the cloth
* Take chenna out of cloth, place it in a plate and knead chenna for 7-8 minutes till it is soft to touch. This decides how soft your rasgulla will eventually be. You can refer to the link to see the exact technique
* Add 1 tbsp maida flour, pinch of baking powder (1/6 tsp). Knead for another 5 minutes. Make round rasgulla balls from the chenna knead.
* Put 250 g sugar in a wok kadhai with 1 ltr water. Stir well. Add 5 pcs of crushed cardamom in the sugar syrup. Boil in high flame.
* Add the rasgulla balls to the syrup. Cover the wok and let it boil for 15 minutes in HIGH FLAME. Open the lid once. Again cover the lid and let it boil for 15 minutes in MEDIUM FLAME.
* Turn off the flame, and leave the wok as it is for 2-3 hours to let the rasgulla balls cool to room temperature

Brown chicken in 1-2 Tablespoons olive oil, soy sauce, garlic, and desired sprinkling of oregano and basil in an electric frying pan at medium heat. When chicken is mostly browned, add sliced mushrooms and onion. Cook, until mushrooms are starting to brown and onions, are beginning to become translucent. Add peppers and cook for an additional 3- 4 minutes. (Do not overcook the vegetables as they will also be baked in the oven.)

PUTTING IT TOGETHER:

Sprinkle with garlic powder, oregano and basil before adding sauce and toppings. Spread peanut butter sauce evenly over surface of flatbread. With a slotted spoon, add contents of electric frying pan, being careful not to add extra liquid. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes to desired to taste.

Bake at 450 for 25 minutes. The crust should be dark golden brown and starting to peel away from the edges of the baking sheet when it is fully baked.

Immediately upon taking the dish out of the oven, sprinkle with green onion. Let stand for 5-10 minutes to cool. Cut into 8 rectangles and serve.",2020-07-11

"Kimbap, Korean Sushi Roll!","Kimbap is a popular picnic food in Korea. I always looked forward to my school picnic day because my mom would get up early and make these delicious rolls for me. Our kitchen smelled like toasted sesame oil all morning.

It does include some processed meat such as Korean ham and imitation crab meat. But if you‚Äôre after vegetarian kimbap, you can simply omit these and perhaps add some cooked seasoned tofu.


[Original recipe is here](https://youtu.be/xmKxz4964xo)

**Ingredients (2 kimbap)**

- 350g steamed rice
- 40g cucumber
- 40g carrot
- 40g burdock root
- 30g spinach
- 100g ham
- 60g pickled radish
- 2 pecies of artificial crab sticks
- 2 dried seaweed sheets

**Instructions**

**Kimbap ingredients preparation**

- Prepare boiling water for spinach.
- Mix 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp salt with steamed rice.
- Cut 40g of cucumber, carrot, burdock root into thin sticks.
- Pour the boiling water in the bowl of spinach.
- Then, cool the spinach in cold water and sqeeze the water out of the spinach.
- Mix the spinach with a pinch of salt.
- Cut the ham into sticks.
- Next, to make an egg omelet, stir 2 eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper.
- Fry the egg on the pan and cut it into strips.
- Cook the ham until all sides are brown.
- Add the artificial crab sticks and lightly cook them.
- Stir fry the carrot, burdock root, 1 tbsp of sugar, soy sauce, and sesame oil all together.
- Put the stir fried vegetables into a strainer.
- Spread the baseball-sized rice evenly on the seaweed.

**Rolled kimbap**

- Arrange all ingredients (spinich, egg, ham, cucumber, crab stick, pickled radish) on the rice and tightly roll using the mat.
- Lastly, brush the kimbap with sesame oil.

**Cutting kimbap**

- Now, brush the knife with sesame oil and cut the kimbap into bite-size pieces.
- Sprinkle the sesame seeds on the kimbap.
- Prepare the leftover pickled radish beside the kimbap.",2020-07-13

# The Best Damn Tomato Pie

Prep time: **00:10**

Cook time: **00:45**

### Main Ingredients

1 deep dish frozen pie shell

4 red, ripe tomatoes (beefsteaks work great)

10 fresh basil leaves, torn or sliced into strips

1 clove minced garlic (or more, depending on your taste)

1 cup mayonnaise

1 cup shredded mozzarella

1 cup shredded cheddar

1/2 cup shredded parmesan

**Recipe Steps**

Wash the tomatoes and pat dry. Using a sharp knife, slice tomatoes about 1/4""-1/2"" thick. If you want to eliminate some of the moisture from the tomatoes, place slices in a colander and salt lightly. Let stand in the fridge for about an hour or two. Lightly shake out the excess moisture, and pat dry gently with paper towels.

1. Parbake the pie shell in a 350 degree oven (about 10 mins), or according to package directions.
2. While the pie shell bakes, in a bowl combine the basil, garlic, mayonnaise and cheeses. Stir well. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Remove the pie shell from the oven. Place the tomato slices evenly in the bottom of the shell, about 2/3rds high. Top with the combined ingredients and spread across the pie evenly.
4. Place the finished pie back in the oven for 30 minutes. It will be golden brown and bubbly.

Brazilian Coxinha with Salpicoa Salad and Dips.,"This is my first attempt at writing a recipe. I think it turned out great and wanted to share my version (as I did a few small things differently, and parts are from different recipes). Any feedback on it would be appreciated.

Images: [https://imgur.com/gallery/sl8y98j](https://imgur.com/gallery/sl8y98j)

\- Cooking Time: 1h 45m ‚Äì 2h. Preparations: 30 minutes (optional), Recipe: 1h 45m

\- Special Equipment: Deep fryer or pan suitable for deep frying (Coxinha and salad), julienne peeler or cutter (salad), blender or food processor (chilli dip)

For making this, I recommend making the dough first, sorting out the inside mix and dips while it rests. Get the potatoes for the salad soaking early, too, so they can be ready for frying after the Coxinha.

\---

\*\*Preperations\*\*

First up, we need to prepare the chicken and stock. You can use pre-cooked roast chicken instead of this method if you prefer.

\*\*Ingredients\*\*

\- Pack of chicken thighs (approx 1.1kg)

\- Oxo Chicken Stock Cube

\- Boiled water (less than 250ml)

\*\*Method\*\*

1. Skip the frying step for the thighs. This is to ‚Äúseal in the flavour‚Äù, but we want the juices to contain flavour, too
2. Add 5 minutes to the suggests cooking time (usually 30 minutes at 180¬∞C fan)
3. Once cooked, pour the juices into a measuring jug. Pour hot water to fill up to 250ml (we want the stock to still be warm when we make the dough).
4. Remove the skin and bone from the chicken, allow to cool while making the dough.

Note: so the chicken skin didn‚Äôt go to waste, I seasoned the skin with a Salt & Chilli grinder and some extra salt and returned to the oven for 5 minutes to crisp as a snack while preparing the rest.

\---

\*\*Chicken Coxinha\*\*

\*\*Ingredients\*\*

Dough:

\- Butter (25g approx)

\- Warm Chicken Stock (250ml) that was prepared earlier

\- Milk (100ml)

\- Plain Flour (450ml), extra for dusting as needed

\- Pinch of salt

Filling:

\- Oil (small amount)

\- Butter (small amount)

\- Onion (half)

\- Approx a quarter of the prepared chicken (or two thighs, bones and skin removed, if buying pre-cooked chicken)

\- Dried mixed herbs (1 tablespoon), other herbs are suitable, tarragon for example.

\- Philadelphia Chives (2 tablespooons), other flavours or soft cheeses also suitable

\- Pinch of salt and pepper

Coating:

\- 1 egg, beaten

\- Breadcrumbs (Approx 150g, extra likely needed), I used a mixture of homemade breadcrumbs and golden breadcrumbs

\- Oil for deep frying

\*\*Method\*\*

1. Start off with the dough. Add 25g butter, the 250ml chicken stock and 100ml milk into a pan on a low heat.
2. Add the 450g of plain flour (I don‚Äôt have scales, so use 850ml) and a pinch of salt and stir.
3. Once the dough starts pulling away from the side of the pan, continue stirring and moving the dough (with the pan still on a low heat) for around 3-4 minutes (make sure it doesn‚Äôt stick and burn) until the dough is stuff.
4. Cover and leave to rest for one hour (I let mine cool then stored it in the fridge for one hour
5. Remove and wash the pan, time to move onto the filling so we‚Äôll need a clean pan.
6. Cut the onion into small pieces, add oil and butter in a pan on medium-high heat and fry the onions until soft but not browned, remove the pan from the heat (it won‚Äôt be going back on, so turn the hob off).
7. Cut the chicken into small chunks and add to the pan.
8. Add in the tablespoon of mixed herbs, 2 tablespoons of Philadelphia/soft cheese and a small amount of salt and pepper (as desired)
9. Mix well and chill until the dough is ready. Now is an ideal time to make the dips, detailed below.
10. Once the dough has rested, dust a chopping board with flower and remove the dough and filling from the fridge.
11. Pull and roll the dough into roughly golf ball size balls. I made 8 with this mixture.
12. Squash a ball into a bowl shape and add the filling
13. Mould the dough up from the sides around the filling to cover and pinch the top to make a teardrop shape. Repeat for all Coxinhas.
14. Dip the Coxinhas into a beatend egg and use another bowl to coat with breadcrumbs.
15. Heat up the oil to 180¬∞C and fry the Coxinhas a couple at a time for approximately 5 minutes until crisp and brown
16. If needed, keep warm in an over at 110¬∞C. While these are being fried, I recommend chopping the potato for the salad so it can be fried straight after the Cohxinas.

\---

\*\*Salpicoa Salad\*\*

\*\*Ingredients\*\*

\* Potatoes (2 large, approx 350g)

\* Rest of prepared chicken, or 1 small cooked chicken (skin/bones removed) if buying pre-cooked

\* 1 green smith apple (I used Granny Smith)

\* 1 red apple (I used Gala)

\* Raisins (optional ‚Äì I dislike them so haven‚Äôt used them)

\* Lime juice (1 tablespoon)

\* Mayonnaise (3 tablespoons)

\* Soured Cream (1 tablespoon)

\*\*Method\*\*

1. It‚Äôs best to start the potatoes alongside preparing the dips. Peel and cut the potatoes into long thin fries. Soak in cold water for 30 minutes.
2. Julienne the red and green apples (cut into tiny strips), add to a bowl.
3. Tear the chicken into strips, add to the apples (and raisins if using).
4. Add the lime, mayo and sour cream and mix well.
5. Store this mix if needed.
6. Once the potatoes are ready, drain and pat dry. Heat oil to 180¬∞C (if making the Coxinhas, they can go in after those) and fry until they are crisp and golden
7. Drain onto kitchen towel.
8. Add the apple/chicken mix onto the plate and scatter the fries on top to serve.

\---

\*\*Brazilian Hot Sauce\*\*

\*\*Ingredients\*\*

\* Red wine vinegar (50ml)

\* Distilled malt vinegar (25ml)

\* Apple juice (80ml) or White Rum/Cacha√ßa

\* Water (80ml)

\* Philadelphia Chive (2 teaspoons)

\* Ground Coriander (1 teaspoon) or fresh chopped coriander

\* Ground peppercorns (1 teaspoon)

\* 1 bay leaf

\* Mixed herbs (1 tablespoon)

\* Pinch of salt

\* Oil

\* 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped

\* Chopped onion (2 tablespoons)

\* 1-3 red chillis (or chilli of choice)

\*\*Method\*\*

1. Pour the 50ml red wine vinegar, 25ml distilled malt vinegar, 80ml apple juice (or alternative) and 80ml water into a pan on a medium-low heat.
2. Add the 2 teaspoons Philadelphia Chive, 1 teaspoon coriander, 1 teaspoon peppercorn, 1 tablespoon mixed herbs, bay and pinch of salt.
3. Bring to the boil and continue to boil for 2 minutes
4. Remove from heat and cover.
5. In a new pan, use a little oil and lightly fry the onion and garlic (try not to burn it) and the chilli peppers whole (stalks removed).
6. Using a sieve, pour the vinegar mixture over the chillis.
7. Cover the pan and cook on a low heat until chillis are soft.
8. Once the chillis are soft, add the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth NOTE: Take cake to not breathe in the steam.
9. Pour into a dish, use extra red wine vinegar to make smoother if needed.

\---

\*\*Brazilian Vinaigrette\*\*

\*\*Ingredients\*\*

\* 1/4 an onion, chopped

\* 1/2 a red pepper, chopped

\* 1/2 a green pepper, chopped

\* 2 tomatoes, chopped

\* red wine vinegar (60ml)

\* Olive Oil (2 tablespoons)

\*\*Method\*\*

1. Roughly chop the onions and peppers and tomatoes and add to a dish
2. Add the 60ml red wine vinegar and 2 tablespoons olive oil and mix well.
3. Chill until needed

Home cooking: Yum Woon Sen (Glass Noodles Salad) SPICY!!,"

I think this dish is unique in its way because of the combination of soft glass noodles combined with lime juice, ground chicken, shrimps, squids, and herbs. If you are a noodles lover and a big fan of seafood, this dish is for you. The ingredients are simple and can be purchased at your local grocery store. I made this recipe according to my liking, especially on the spicy side, but feel free to reduce the amount of the chili on your own accord.

"Every week I cook a Middle Eastern recipe, last week I made Vermicelli Rice, a staple of Middle Eastern cuisines.","Today's dish is [Vermicelli Rice](https://imgur.com/a/TQtfUkj), rice cooked with fried vermicelli that is eaten on nearly all middle eastern tables. I thought I would make a post about this recipe as it's eaten with most middle eastern dishes and I served it alongside the [Molokhia/Jute leaf stew] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/h9fufc/every_week_i_cook_a_middle_eastern_recipe_this/) I made a few weeks back.  
*This post is a little late but please enjoy regardless. I have a very special Eid recipe coming next week*

## What is Vermicelli Rice:
Vermicelli is a thin noodle or pasta that is commonly eaten in east Asian countries including China, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. In most Asian countries the vermicelli is made from rice flour and is extremely thin in size. Vermicelli is also the name given to a pasta in Italy that is similar in shape to spaghetti but is slightly bigger. Vermicelli is actually used in both sweet and savoury dishes, and is a common carbohydrate in many Asian cuisines. Some of the easily recognizable dishes that utilize Vermicelli are Vermicelli Pudding and Singapore Noodles. Although Middle Eastern vermicelli and Asian vermicelli look a lot alike, the kind used in the Middle East is generally made from wheat flour or semolina as opposed to rice flour.

Vermicelli rice consists of soft rice and fried vermicelli cooked together. The two carbohydrates work great together, their textures complement each other nicely, the softness of the cooked rice works great with the slipperiness and slight chewiness of the vermicelli. To cook the dish vermicelli is lightly fried in fat before being cooked with the rice using stock, this results in a delicious side dish that has a slight flavour of meat or chicken as well as a light baked or nutty aroma from the fried vermicelli. Although it is largely associated with Egyptian Cuisine, these days rice with vermicelli is eaten in nearly all middle eastern countries and is one of the main ways of cooking rice for most meals. In some countries such as Egypt, it's uncommon to be served plain white rice at all unless it is a component of another dish, throughout my childhood I was always fed vermicelli rice. It is served as the main side dish with most vegetable or meat dishes, the fluffiness and moist texture means it is also served next to drier main dishes such as grills and fried foods as opposed to only alongside saucy foods. 
## History:
There is no source which can 100% claim where vermicelli reached the middle east from, however vermicelli seems to have been a component of cuisines in the region since the 10th century. It's likely that the pasta travelled to the middle east along the silk road as part of the exchange of spices and foods, but this is just stipulation. Vermicelli has been mentioned under two different names from this time period, Rishta and Itriya. These two pastas were then used in stews and desserts including a chicken stew in the 10th century Kitab al Tabeekh cook book. When the rice and vermicelli marriage actually happened is unclear.

## Flavor Profile:
Vermicelli develops a nutty almost baked aroma when fried which gives a nice background flavour to the dish, I have found that toasting it till just lightly browned works best, any more than that and you risk adding some burnt notes which aren't nice. There aren't many components in this rice dish to give it a strong flavour, however the use of stock when cooking the rice as opposed to water imparts the flavour of the stock on the rice. The general rule with cooking this rice is to use stock that compliments the protein you are serving it next to. Most stocks in the middle east will be seasoned with Cardamom, Pepper, Bay Leafs, Garlic, Onions and sometimes Mastic or Cinnamon. The stock I used was a chicken stock I had made previously and contained all of the above spices except for the cinnamon. If you want a good middle eastern stock recipe, then check out the one I did in my [Musakhan Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/gz18hz/every_week_i_cook_a_middle_eastern_recipe_this/).


## Rice variety choice:
Depending on the country in the middle east you go to, this dish will be made with different types of rice. In the Arabian Peninsula, the most commonly used rice is Basmati and you can use it for this dish, though I feel the texture of Long Grain Basmati with Vermicelli kind of misses the point as you have two similar shapes and textures in the same dish. In the Levant you tend to get more Long Grain rice, think Uncle Bens Long Grain white rice. This works good for the dish but the rice tends to have a bit of a more chewy consistency than I like in this dish. My personal favourite for this setting aside my biases is Egyptian Rice.

Egyptian rice is a Medium-Short grain rice similar to Arborio rice in shape. The grain of the rice is about three quarters the size of Arborio and crucially does not have the same starchy layer on the outside. Both Arborio and Egyptian rice are thought to have been bred from Japonica rice and so that would explain the similarities. If you don't have a middle eastern supermarket near you, then you can just use Japanese Ordinary Rice instead. This is a class of Japanese rices that are used in things such as bento boxes and with meals. The texture of this is very similar to Egyptian Rice, make sure to get ordinary Japanese rice and not glutinous rice.

## Notes and tips:
* Frying vermicelli is quite easy and only takes a few minutes, but you should stay by the pot as it can burn really easily
* Try get the short straight kind of vermicelli, there are whole long vermicelli noodles which work but you will have to cut them. Try not to get the curly kind of vermicelli as this has a tendency to break when frying
* I use both butter and oil when frying the vermicelli and rice. This is because it's traditional to use ghee which has a higher smoke point yet still contains the delicious butter flavour. Instead of ghee I use butter and oil which results in a similar flavour and texture than either one alone
* If you are a huge fan of crispy rice, you'll be pleased to know that sometimes you get a delicious layer of crisped rice stuck in the bottom of the pot. It's my favourite part and if you want to make even more you could increase the oil a bit so more rice fries

## Ingredients:
Makes 2 large (3-4 small) servings

1 Cup Medium Grain Rice (preferably Egyptian, but Japanese works too)  
1/3 Cup short Vermicelli  
500ml (17 fl oz) of stock (match the stock flavour to the main dish you are serving)  
1 Tbsp Butter  
1 Tbsp Vegetable oil  
1 Tsp Salt  
1/2 Tsp White Pepper (Black works fine too but it gives a stronger taste than white pepper)  

## Directions:
Place your rice in a large bowl and fill with room temperature water  
Mix the rice with the water and agitate it to rinse off the surface starch   
Pour out the water when it gets murky and repeat the washing process 3 more times (4 total times for Egyptian rice, wash until water runs close to clear)  
Pour washed rice out into a sieve or colander to drain for 30 mins - 1 hour (you should move it around a few times during this period so it can all drain)  
Prepare your stock by adding the salt and pepper to it and mixing to dissolve (even if your stock is seasoned, you need it to be quite salty so the finished rice is well seasoned)  
When the rice has dried (it should be pearlescent white), add the butter and oil to a pot with a tight fitting lid over medium heat (non stick or stainless steel work great, make sure to use a pot with a thick bottom)  
Let the butter melt then add the vermicelli and fry for 2-3 minutes until a medium brown in color  
Add the dried rice to the vermicelli and mix well to combine. If your rice hasn't fully dried then fry it for a few minutes until it turns pearlescent white  
Flatten the rice out into a single flat layer and scrape down any stray grains from the walls  
Pour enough stock over the rice to cover it, you want to pour it to about 1.5cm or 1/2in above the level of the rice  
Cover the pot with the lid and turn the heat up  
Leave the pot to come to a boil, and then wait until the water has all boiled off (try not to open the lid too many times, wait for the sound of boiling to subside before checking)  
When the water has evaporated, turn the heat down to the lowest setting, and leave the rice to steam with the lid on for 20 minutes  
After 20 minutes, check the rice for doneness, if cooked set the lid ajar for excess steam to escape  
Spoon out onto a platter to serve, if you like the crispy rice, divide it into equal pieces and place around the plate

Measure Eggs by Volume,"Here is something that is taught to chefs. For basic recipes like scrambled eggs volume does not matter. But if you are baking sometimes you do not have the same size eggs called for in the recipe. When in doubt about a North American recipe that calls for **eggs** but does not specify the size use large eggs:

Here are liquid measurements to use in converting egg sizes for recipes:

* 4 Extra Large whole eggs = 1 cup
* 6 Extra Large egg whites = 1 cup
* 12 Extra Large egg yolks = 1 cup
* 1 Extra Large whole egg = 4 tablespoons or 1/4 cup
* 1 Extra Large egg white = 2 extra large egg yolks (in volume)
* 1 Extra Large egg yolk = 1 tablespoon (approximately)
* 5 Large whole eggs = 1 cup
* 8 - 10 Large egg whites = 1 cup
* 12 - 16 Large egg yolks = 1 cup
* 1 Large whole egg = 3 tablespoons
* 1 Large egg white = 2 tablespoons
* 1 Large egg yolk = 1 tablespoon

If a recipe calls for 1 or 2 Large eggs you can substitute the same number of eggs of any other size it will not affect the recipe. If a recipe calls for 3 Large eggs use 3 Extra Large or two Jumbo eggs. 

I did not include information for medium or jumbo eggs. If you use these often I can provide the measurements.",2020-07-15

Curry dilemma!!!,"I absolutely love hot food, specifically hot wings and curry. But despite being a lover of curries (nearly all) I just love the flavour of a chicken tikka masala. My local curry house does one which is banging, it is really sweet and I'm friendly with them so I always ask if I can have it as hot as a Vindaloo, they haven't failed yet.

Since lockdown I have missed my favourite curry. I'm fairly handy around the kitchen and want to try and replicate this dish.

Anybody got any recommendations on how to? It's quite sweet, not got an over powering tomato flavour. It is really thick. Most importantly I want to crank up the heat.

Thanks in advance!!",2020-07-16

"Hatch Chile Stovetop Mac & Cheese | $1.31 per serving, 6 ingredients, 15 minutes total time","This is a super simple [stovetop mac & cheese](https://imgur.com/fY3cn95) recipe with a few simple tweaks and additions. It uses easy to remember ratios--which is something I also loved about [my last recipe](https://old.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/hc1yko/cacio_e_pepe_087_per_serving_only_3_ingredients/)--and take about 15 minutes of hands-on time, if you are fast. 

&nbsp;

---

### **Required special equipment:** 

* Digital kitchen scale

* Fine mesh strainer


---

&nbsp;

### **Notes:**

**This recipe is for two portions**. You can easily scale this up, as needed. I have successfully made a double batch. One important thing to consider is the width of your pot, because the width of the pot affects how quickly water evaporates, and we will be cooking the pasta until almost all of the water has evaporated. For two portions, I use a pot that has an interior diameter of 7 inches. For the double recipe, I used a pot that has an interior diameter of 9 inches. This is important. 

I call for sodium citrate in this recipe. Sodium citrate is probably a special-order item for most of you, so I will provide an alternative to using this. For those who are curious, you can buy SC on Amazon for less than $8 USD. SC is the key ingredient for making those ultra-smooth and velvety cheese sauces. It is an emulsifier, and it prevents (or makes it really difficult) cheese sauces from breaking. It also makes it possible to re-heat the mac & cheese without the cheese breaking. It's really great stuff!

To skip the sodium citrate, you will want to use 2 ounces of American cheese. Yes, that's right, Kraft singles. You can go fancy deli American cheese if you wish, but it will make no difference here. We are simply after the sodium citrate that is already within the Kraft singles. That is one of the things that make it such a great melting cheese. In addition to using 2 ounces of American cheese (exactly 3 Kraft singles), you will want to stick to younger and good melting cheese, like mild or medium cheddar, Monterey jack, or fontina cheese. Avoid using sharp or other aged cheeses, as it will not stay as melty without using the sodium citrate. 

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

### **Ingredients:**

* 6 ounces (170g) elbow macaroni, or other short pasta
* 6 ounces (170g) evaporated milk
* 6 ounces (170g) shredded cheese blend (3 oz sharp cheddar, 2 oz gruy√®re, 1 oz parmigiano-reggiano)
* 3 ounces (85g) hatch chile salsa, or diced green chiles
* 1 teaspoon sodium citrate
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard



&nbsp;

### **Prep (mise en place)**: 

* Grate all of your cheese and weigh it into one large bowl, refrigerate until needed.

* Weigh out 3 ounces of the hatch chile salsa and then separate the solids from the liquids by passing it through a fine mesh strainer and pressing the solids with a flexible spatula. Reserve both the solids and liquids in separate bowls. 

* Weigh out the evaporated milk and refrigerate until needed. 

&nbsp;

### **Instructions:**

1. Weigh out 6 ounces of dry pasta and add it to a cold 4-quart saucepan that is about 7-8 inches in diameter. Add ¬Ω teaspoon of salt. Add the reserved hatch chile juice to the dry pasta. Rinse out the bowl with water and add that to the pasta. Now add water to the pasta until the water just barely covers the top of the pasta. 


2. Set the pot over high heat, bring the water to a boil and stir frequently so that all of the pasta cooks evenly. Let the pasta boil until almost all of the water has been absorbed or  evaporated. This should take about 6-7 minutes. Once there is no more than 1/4 cup of pasta water remaining, immediately add the evaporated milk. 
  * Do not drain the pasta water. If there is more than 1/4 cup, just keep boiling until it is reduced. It is better to over-cook the pasta than have too much water at this point. If the pan is dry before the pasta is cooked, add water in 1/4 cup increments until it is cooked. 

3. Add the sodium citrate if using, stir to dissolve, and bring the evaporated milk to a boil. Once it begins to boil, turn the heat to low and add the cheese, one third at a time, mixing well after each addition. 

4. Once all of the cheese has melted, turn off the heat and fold in the reserved hatch chiles and Dijon mustard. Taste and add more salt if needed.

Korean-Thai-Japanese fusion spicy kimchee soup,"I stumbled on this one when trying to use up some ingredients in my fridge and it turned out so well I have to share. 

Ingredients:

1 cube vegetable stock
1/4 cup diced white onion
1/4 cup diced red pepper 
1 bok choi, chopped
1/3 cup kimchee, chopped 
1/2 tsp of Japanese spicy yuzu paste
1 tsp of tom yum soup paste
3-4 diced cherry tomatoes
4 slices of prosciutto, sliced into ribbons (optional)

Boil 3 cups of water, add 1 cube of veggie stock. Add diced onions and red pepper and simmer on high until they tenderize. Add yuzu and tom yum pastes. Add bok choi, stem pieces a little earlier to give them more time to tenderize. Add tomatoes and prosciutto. Simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes to allow flavours to diffuse. 

Tom yum and yuzu amounts can be easily adjusted to suit how much spice you like, but as it is it packed a definite kick. The prosciutto added a nice savoury counterpoint to the spice, but you could sub in seafood, chicken, or leave it veggie. Enjoy!",2020-07-17

Will this work for a mushroom flatbread? (no time to test),"Tl;dr If anyone's made something like this, how do you think it'll go?

The idea is a light flatbread pizza to go alongside denser foods.

Ingredients 

* Store bought flatbread \~   
should I buy raw pizza dough or cooked pizza/flatbread? I've only seen cooked versions before but I'm worried since it's ready to eat it might burn easily in the oven
* Mozzarella \~  
this is the base layer of cheese; if there's anything more exciting lmk
* Parmesan/Pecorino \~  
this will be shaved/grated on at the end. No debate on this one since I have leftovers
* Mushrooms \~   
one of two main veggies. I've only have flatbreads with one type: cremini mushrooms but I'm trying to find excuses to try out fancy ones like chanterelle, but I've never used anything other than white or cremini before. Mushroom experts lmk. I'm thinking chanterelle/portebello, hard no on oyster/enoki. Idk any others. Also debating whether to just put on the mozzarella, or if I should pre-cook with some for of glaze. Balsamic? Red wine vinegar? 
* Argulua \~   
other main veggie. To be sprinkled in last few minutes of baking.
* Balsamic vinegar \~   
drizzle over the top to serve. 

My main questions are is there supposed to be any kind of sauce base, like on a normal pizza? Just mozzarella and mushrooms seems like a really dry/boring base. Then, should I use ""special"" mushrooms or are those too much? Lastly idk if balsamic is enough as a dressing/sauce or if I should add something else.",2020-07-19

How To Cook Chicken Teriyaki At Home! A Step By Step Guide!,"How To Cook Chicken Teriyaki At Home! A Step By Step Guide!

Full Video Recipe:¬†[https://youtu.be/kbbpElK5Ge8](https://youtu.be/kbbpElK5Ge8)

You will need:

2 Chicken Thighs

2 Tbsp Teriyaki Sauce (Full Video Recipe at:¬†[https://youtu.be/xgPqH4xk6Zc](https://youtu.be/xgPqH4xk6Zc))

3 to 4 Tsp of Corn Starch

Vegetable Oil

Steps:

To make this teriyaki chicken at home:

1) Prepare 2 Chicken Thighs that have been deboned with their skins left on. Take some kitchen serviettes and lightly pat dry both sides of the Chicken Thighs

2) Place the Chicken Thighs into a Ziploc bag. Without sealing the Ziploc bag, use a frying pan and slowly flatten out the Chicken Thighs while trying to keep them even.

3) Carefully dust about 3 to 4 Tsp of Corn Starch into the Ziploc bag. Try your best to spread the Corn Starch as evenly as you can onto the Chicken Thighs. Seal the Ziploc bag up and give it a good shake to even coat the Chicken Thighs.

4) Grab a pot lid that is smaller than the frying pan you intend you fry the Chicken Thighs in. Prepare some aluminium foil and gently wrap the aluminium foil around the pot lid.

5) Heat up a pan on medium heat with some Vegetable Oil. Once the pan is hot, place the Chicken Thighs skin side down into the pan. Cover the Chicken Thighs with the Pot Lid and let them cook for about 6 minutes or until the skins on the Chicken Thighs are nicely browned.

6) Flip the Chicken Thighs and let the Chicken Thighs continue to cook for about another 3 minutes.¬†

7) Remove the Chicken Thighs from the heat and carefully slice each Chicken Thigh into 6 slices.¬†

8) Add the Chicken Thighs back into the frying pan and add about 2 Tbsp of Teriyaki Sauce. Allow the sauce to reduce and the Chicken Thighs to absorb the Teriyaki Sauce.

9) Serve with rice and enjoy!",2020-07-19
How to make the best hot chili oil in less than 10 minutes!,"It's the base for many chinese dishes and goes with almost everything, sandwiches, pizza, dumplings etc. Although very easy to make, be extra careful when handling the oil.

Here is how it looks like: [https://youtu.be/RnVvUMibuXQ](https://youtu.be/RnVvUMibuXQ)

**Ingredients needed:**

* 30g chili flakes (mild)
* 30g chili flakes (hot)
* 4g salt
* 8g sesame seeds
* 1/2 tsp sichuan pepper (or normal black pepper corns)
* 1/3 tsp ground sichuan pepper ( or normal ground black pepper)
* 1 star anise
* 2 teaspoons water
* 250ml Cooking oil
* 1/2 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp vinegar
* 1clove of garlic

**Instructions:**

1. Mince the garlic and mix it together with the salt, chili flakes and 2 tsp of water. Use a heat resistant bowl for that (e.g. ceramic or a pot) since we will be pouring hot oil into it later.
2. Add the soy sauce and vinegar and stir well. Make sure there are no clumps.
3. Sprinkle the sesame seeds on top of it.
4. Heat up the oil and roast the pepper corns and star anise for 1 or 2 minutes. Take them out before they are burnt.
5. Now we slowly pour the hot oil into the chili bowl. Be careful to not pour all the oil at once. Pour in a little bit, let it sizzle and stir it before pouring more oil. Keep stirring while carefully pouring the oil. Be patient and don‚Äôt add it too fast, otherwise it will taste burnt. The trick is to keep a little bit of oil at the end and pour it when the sizzle subsides.

Voil√†, we're done!",2020-07-19

I hate green bell peppers. Help me like them.,"I forgot to customize my produce box one week and they saddled me with a bunch of green bell peppers. I HATE green bell peppers with a passion. They suck. It's my opinion, and I'm not changing it.

That said, I hated getting red bell peppers in the past too but I found some things I can do with them that I love, like oven-roasting them, and storing them in oil to use in making romesco sauce or as pizza toppings etc. They lose all their vegetal taste when you roast them.

But I don't think the same can be said for green bell peppers.

Do you guys have any recipes for things I can do with green bell peppers that will help me like them or at least tolerate them? I would hate to just throw them in the trash.

(note: once I did pickle them, and it was slightly tolerable because they mostly just tasted like the pickling brine, but they weren't my favorite and eventually I had to throw them out because I would never eat them often enough)",2020-07-19

Tracking your favorite recipes,"Hi all!

I like to cook a relatively wide range of dishes and over time I have developed a list of 'favorites' that I seem to come back to time and time again.  Right now, they are just in a google keep list on my phone, but I was thinking that it would be nice to have the recipes organized and maybe physically printed out.  It would have to be something that could be added to over time.  Anyone had any advice or ideas for how to do this?  Something like a photo album comes to mind, but is there something more bespoke for recipes out there?",2020-07-22

Frozen Bars!," 

This is a very nice recipe that me and my SO thought. I am sure there are other recipes with these ingredients, but we slowly come up with interesting ideas with ingredients we like.

https://preview.redd.it/195v0wwg6gc51.jpg?width=3613&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41028adbe36dea51c4d8b6d755acdb88c18a3da2

Frozen Bars.

Base:

6 ts peanut butter

4 ts honey (3+1 when done kneading)

2 ts tahini

oats

Chocolate topping:

50 gr chocolate

1 ts margarine

We put all the ingredients together in a bowl (except oats) and we mix with a spoon. Slowly we add oats until it is a mass, then we knead with our hand. That's where I add the last ts of honey so it will be nicely combined.

We put in a small oven pan (or anywhere we want) and we give it the shape we want. We put in the freezer.

In 15-25 minutes it will be frozen enough.

We melt the chocolate with the margarine in a ben-mari, but we let it cool for a bit.

When our base is frozen, we pour the chocolate topping on top.

We freeze for at least 5 minutes more.

Enjoy!",2020-07-22

"Fig loaf fully baked, yet ""undercooked"" centre?","So I made this recipe: https://leelalicious.com/earl-grey-tea-cake/

That I'd made before, but *didn't add the earl grey or the glaze* , and instead *added 107gr of fresh figs, 55gr of dark chocolate and orange zest*. Baked it for 45ish minutes at around 160-165¬∞C,  smelt fine and was beautifully golden, rose wonderfully, but the middle was a bit...sticky and doughy, like underbaked. Except it wasn't as all the pricking came clean. 

It tastes fine, in fact, amazing, but I was wondering if I just added too many figs?

I just experimented and put it in a 175¬∞C oven, covered in foil, for 20 mins (checking first at 5mins, then another 5, then 10) and it was STILL that weird, sticky in the centre. So wondering what was the cause, and if it was the figs, would reducing the amount to 50 or 60gr be good?",2020-07-23

I didn't add a few (looking at you grilled cheese and 7 cheese toastie guys/gals) cause those don't fit the bill of adventurous foods.

Homemade Dijon Mustard,"Here is something to try if you have some time on your hands and you want to experiment. It is really easy to make Dijon mustard it just takes time:

**Equipment**:

2 quart saucepan

Large bowl

Fine mesh sieve/strainer

Plastic wrap

Spatula

Food processor or stick blender

Jar (mason or clamp lid)

**Ingredients**:

1/3 cup white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar

1/3 cup dry white wine (I like Sauvignon Blanc)

1 chopped shallot or 1/2 onion chopped

1 minced clove garlic

6 Tablespoons mustard seeds (yellow, brown or a combination)

3/4 teaspoon of salt

1/4 teaspoon of white pepper

sugar (optional)

**Steps:**

Combine white wine, vinegar, onion, and garlic in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature and pour through strainer into a large bowl. Use the onions and garlic in an omelette or vinaigrette.

Add mustard seeds to liquid. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and soak seeds for at least 24 hours.

Strain liquid and reserve. Puree mustard seeds, with salt and pepper, to desired consistency using a food processor or stick blender. Add reserved soaking liquid until it is the texture you want. Taste and adjust seasoning. Add a little sugar if too strong.

If you want smooth mustard pass pureed mustard through strainer.

Spoon into very clean jar and seal. Refrigerate to allow flavors to blend for at least 1 week, if you can.

**NOTE**: If you want hotter mustard substitute water for white wine.

**Serving variations**: stir in pureed fresh fruit (applesauce, grapes, plums, peaches, cherries) or dried fruit before using. If you use dried fruit, soak it first.",2020-07-25

Lost German Recipes Question,"Hello! Guten Tag! I was wanting to know if I could get some help with finding older recipes/cookbooks.  My Oma was born in East Prussia before the second world war, and because of dementia has forgotten most of her recipes, none of which were written down. We are slowly recreating things that we saw her make once or twice, like her Potato Salad. But recipes like her homemade Saurkraut, Goulash, Deviled Eggs, and even Mashed Potatoes have been completely lost so far sadly. I was just wanting to know if you could send recipes from your Oma's or pages from cookbooks to help me get a leg up on recreating these!  


Her Mashed potatoes were smooth, no chunks, no skins, and she would put something into them, maybe a cream? These were the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten. We would eat the Mashed Potatoes along with corn and her Goulash on top. Her Goulash looked hungarian, but a little thicker.

Gold Bars - Old School Snack,"When I was growing up, these things were sold in every school's snack bar for $.25.  Recently I ran across them again in one of the local boutique cookie shops, and decided to see if I could recreate the recipe at home.  Here's what I discovered:

Ingredients:

* 1 16oz. jar (2 cups) peanut butter - Nutritionally it's better to use Natural peanut butter without added sugars, but for the sake of authenticity, you'll want to use the cheapest you can find.
* 2 cups powdered sugar, sifted
* 2 cups Rice Krispies cereal
* 4 tbsp melted butter
* 2 tbsp simple syrup or light corn syrup (simple syrup can be made by bringing equal parts water and cane sugar to a boil until the sugar dissolves completely)
* 1 12oz. pkg semisweet chocolate chips
* pinch of sea salt (change to 1 tsp sea salt if using Natural peanut butter)

Mix the butter and syrup in a large bowl, then stir in the powdered sugar and peanut butter.  When these are thoroughly blended, fold in the Rice Krispies.  Spread this mixture evenly into an 11""x7"" or 9""x9"" baking pan lined with parchment paper or plastic wrap.  Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave, and spread the chocolate evenly over the top of the peanut butter mixture.  Refrigerate until the chocolate loses its sheen, then cut into squares.  Chill until set completely, about 3-4 hours.",2020-07-27

Healthier Grilled Sausages with More Crispy Bits,"hi r/recipes. With the contiuned heat, I grilled some sausages outdoors this weekend. Now sausages are delicious, but often can be pretty heavy and fatty. I tried a method that removes this excess greasiness while still maintaining a good degree of juciness and gives more surface area for that smoky browned goodness from a grill. You can also not drain them if you don't want to, but the cooking times might change.

Whole process from start to finish takes about 45 mins depending on how smoky and charred you like your sausages, and I tried 2 methods for the **initial cooking** of the sausages. Once that's done, both methods **finish** **cooking** on the grill. Here's a video of me making them to help out!

[https://youtu.be/2eX8HD1nRQM](https://youtu.be/2eX8HD1nRQM)

Below is the list of ingredients and tools. It's not exactly extensive, there's 1 ingredient and not too many tools are really needed.

**Ingredients:**

* Sausages (and that's about it)

**Tools:**

* Large Pot
* Tongs/Chopsticks/Spatula/Slotted Spoon
* Grill
* Paper
* Wood & Twigs
* Charcoal

**Method 1:**

1. Place Sausages in a pot of water
2. Bring it to a boil, then reduce heat to a gentle simmer
3. Simmer for 6 - 8 mins
4. Take the sausages out, then slice in half

**Method 2:**

1. Set up the grill with the paper, wood/twigs, and charcoal (I used 9 briquettes for 6 sausages)
2. Light the paper, cover with the grate, and let it all burn for a bit, until you start to see a bit of white on the charcoal
3. Set the sausages directly over the charcoals
4. Let them cook like this for 2 mins, then give the sausages a quarter turn
5. Repeat this procedure until you've gone all the way around the sausage
6. Slice em in half

**Final Cooking:**

1. Place the sausage halves cut side up directly atop the smoking charcoal in one layer. Cook for 5 mins
2. If there's not enough space for all the sausage halves, then work in batches. Remove the first batch of sausage halves, set aside somewhere else on the grill, and place the next batch atop the charcoals cut side up for another 5 mins.
3. Once you've cooked all batches cut side up for 5 mins, place them cut side down atop the charcoals for 5 mins. You can stack the sausage halves on top of each other in layers at this point
4. Rotate the layers of sausages every 5 mins until you get to the level of browning desired

Pretty simple! Method 1 is easier as you don't have to control a fire so intensely like in Method 2 and you don't risk sausages bursting open. However Method 2 gives more smoke flavor (and I like it more).

The cutting the sausages in half is what drains a lot of the fattiness, and lowers the calorie count. But the sausages should still be plenty juicy as long as you're attentive, and you get more maillard browning because there's 2 sides that can get crispy!

I did this on a charcal grill, but it can be done on a gas grill too. If you want a smoky flavor though, then you can wrap some wood in foil and set it directly on one of your burners - i've never done this as I don't own a gas grill, so be careful!

How to decide on recipes as a beginner?,"Hello everyone on r/Recipes!

Thai Garlic Beef (Nua Tod Kratium),"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ov89abqtomd51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84fab3be5a4321a7967b366aab05f37f3f0dd99e

It is safe to say, I love garlic. I use it in so many of my dishes as it adds a beautiful fragrant taste. 

If you like the idea of crispy garlic and love a good beef stir fry, this dish is definitely for you. Plus, all of these ingredients can be found at any big local grocery store. Oh and wait, it can be made in under 30 mins. Can we say win-win? 

**Recipe: Nua Tod Kratium (Stir Fry Garlic Beef)**  
Serves 2-3

* Blog: https://www.mythaicomfortfood.com

* 1 bulb Garlic, finely chopped
* 1 tsp Ground Pepper
* 6 TB Vegetable Oil
* 3 TB Light Soy Sauce
* 1 TB Oyster Sauce
* 3 TB Sugar
* 1 Egg

**Directions: Preparation**

1. Sliced the beef in thin slices, around 1 inch in length
2. Finely chop the garlic and separate them into 2 portions. We will use one for the stir-fry and one to marinate the beef. If you like, keep the skin of the garlic for one portion.
3. Place beef in a mixing bowl and add one part fresh chopped garlic, ground pepper, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar
4. Mix it well and refrigerate it overnight
5. Set the pan to medium heat, add 3 TB of vegetable oil. Saute half the garlic (with peel if preferred) until golden crispy and set it aside
6. Using the same pan if you like, cook one egg, sunny side up

**Methods: Stir Fry Beef**

1. Preheat the pan or wok on medium heat with some vegetable oil
2. Place the beef in the pan and keep stirring until the meat is done to your level of ‚Äúdone‚Äù (i.e. medium well, well done, etc)
3. Place the meat in the serving dish and garnish it with toasted garlic. Serve with fried egg and rice",2020-07-28

Fudge - Chewy or Crumbly?,"So I remember being a kid and around the holidays my family would give out holiday bags to family and friends, and a lot of the time it would include fudge. Well my family ended up moving different areas around the country (America) and it's been nearly 12 years since that last piece of decadent fudge I had, and i'm 22 now. The reason i'm making this quite random post is because no matter how hard i look i cant find the fudge that used to be in those bags. All fudge i see or get now is soft, chewy, and sticky, and to me personally its kind of off putting. The fudge that i want is dry, almost unbearably dry, very crumbly, and rich in flavor, but its not exactly chocolaty flavor, but the only other way i can describe it is as creamy. So it doesn't make sense, how can something be dry, creamy, and chocolate fudge all at the same time. If anyone knows what im trying to make sense of here can you give a recipe or a link to a recipe on how to make it? Thanks for any comments.",2020-07-29

Savory Blender Recipes?,"Hi all, apologies if this is redundant or silly question. For the past several months I‚Äôve been having issues that make it hard to swallow food. As such, I‚Äôve switched to a primarily liquid diet although certain softer foods are OK (Think pudding, yogurt, pastes etc.). While smoothies and other things are great, it‚Äôs a lot of sweet flavors, and I crave savory stuff, especially something that I can actually eat rather than drink (I have a disability that makes eating drippy things with a spoon hard, so while soups help me get some of the flavors I crave, they are a pain to eat). Do y‚Äôall have any suggestions? I feel like my google-fu is missing key terms, or this is just a not-at-all-strangely uninvestigated space. 

For reference one thing I have had luck with is putting saag paneer in the blender. It yields a paste with a perfect consistency and an oh-so satisfying taste, but even I can‚Äôt eat that too many times in a row. Certain other foods (see general Tso‚Äôs Chicken) have not fared so well. 

All that said I will gladly take any superb smoothie recipes‚ÄîI was just hoping to find savory things that are thick enough to be eaten with a fork. Any and all advice is appreciated!",2020-07-29

Ratatouille Proven√ßale (Classic Recipe),"Hello everyone! 

I've noticed a lot of Confit Byaldi (the ""fake"" Ratatouille from the Pixar movie) being submitted on Reddit but no real ratatouille. The Confit is a very good dish but quite long to prepare.

I'm a French guy born and raised in Provence (where the classic dish comes from) so I thought I would share the recipe of the classic ""Ratatouille Proven√ßale"".

###Ingredients (2-3 servings)

* 2 tablespoons of olive oil (the actual spoon, not the U.S measurement unit which varies from one country to another)
* 2-3 garlic cloves
* 2-3 oignons
* 2 eggplants
* 2 big zucchinis
* 2 big bellpeppers (red or green)
* 3 tomatoes with tomato paste OR just tomato sauce (300 mL)
* Thyme, Oregano, Rosemary (Herbes de Provence mix) and 2 bay leaves. 
* Salt and pepper
* 1 big saucepan with a lid and a big wooden spoon

###Recipe

* All ingredients should be at room temperature
* Dice the onions
* Finely chop the garlic cloves
* Put the saucepan on medium heat and add the oil, wait 30 seconds so it's hot enough
* Add the onion and garlic, stir so that the oil evenly coats all the bits, put the lid on, let it cook until it becomes translucent (3-5 min)
* Put it on low heat
* Add the tomato sauce (or tomatoes + paste) and all the herbs
* Let it cook 10-15 minutes (with the lid on), the goal here is to remove the acidity from the tomato to keep things sweet. If you want to cheat, you can add a pinch of sugar.
* Wash and dice the eggplants in 1.5 cm parts (don't peel it) then add it into the mix.
* Wash, seed, and dice the bellpeppers in 1.5 cm parts then add it into the mix.
* Wash and dice the zucchinis in 1,5 cm parts (don't peel it) then add it in to the mix.
* Add pepper and coarse salt (it'll make the vegetables sweat) and stir the ingredients a bit to avoid having layers.
* Let it cook with the lid on long enough for all the ingredients to soften and sweat the water out (25 min?)
* Remove the lid. There should be quite a lot of water in the saucepan.
* Put it on low heat and let it cook for a while, just checking from time to time if nothing is burning. If the water is evaporating too fast, lower the heat or put the lid back on for a few minutes (30-40 min).
* Just taste if everything is cooked enough (some people like a bit of texture, others prefer when everything is super soft). 
* Season if needed and put the whole thing on high heat.
* Let the ingredients caramelize a bit but not burn, you should hear them fry for 30-40 secs then stir the whole thing so that all ingredients are evenly caramelized. 
* You should notice the ratatouille going from a colourful arrangement of distinct colours to a more [uniform and creamy brown-red color](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Ratatouille-Dish.jpg/1280px-Ratatouille-Dish.jpg). The whole thing should look like a messy mushy working-class dish, which it exactly is. It's NOT a particularly good-looking dish.
* You should be able to taste all the ingredients yet it should feel like a uniform, slightly sweetened taste. 

###Additional info

* I personally love to eat ratatouille with buckweat wholegrain semolina, but honestly it goes very well with rice or quinoa. 

* Some people also like to add some fried eggs in their plate.

* It's also very good served cold or at room temperature.

* Very healthy (low calories), very filling and very tasty. It's great when you're on a diet and don't feel like starving yourself.

* It's a pretty straightforward recipe so it relies on good products. It's always better to go for smaller, tastier organic vegetables and adjust the quantities than go for big tasteless products. Definitely a summer dish to eat when the ingredients are in season.",2020-07-29
5 Minute Meals - I made a bunch of 5-minute meal recipes that you can use to save time or if you're in a rush!,"Hi r/recipes! Not your normal post, but I haven't seen many recipes for people who work long hours and don't have a ton of time to cook. So, I made this guide!

4. Add rice/quinoa on top of arugula, then 1/2 can of chickpeas, and cherry tomatoes
5. Cut sweet potatoe in half and add to container
6. Add a dollop of hummus on top of the chickpeas

NOTE: You may want to add the hummus right before eating so you don't heat the hummus when warming it up, otherwise, you can eat it cold

# Final Notes

* I saved time by microwaving two uncle ben's instant rice at a time
* You can save more time by always making sure the microwave is going, i.e. immediately throw the frozen vegetables in, then the sweet potatoes, then rice
* I specifically chose cherry tomatoes as they don't need to be prepped or cut for the salads
* I also saved dishes by using paper bowls, and reusing the same paper bowl throughout (i.e. mixing the tuna and making the lentil-tahini mash)
* I think most of these will be quite filling, I'm going to be eating them over the next week and will report back
* Also, you can save even more time by making a smaller variety of meals, i.e. if you only made 2 or 3 different meals for the week, you'd save a lot of time, but I like variety so I did a bunch",2020-07-29

Homemade coconut yogurt is runny,"Hi there, I tried making homemade coconut yogurt for the first time but it is runny, almost like a milk instead of a yogurt. What could I have done wrong? Here's the recipe I followed:

&#x200B;

\- 400 ml coconut milk, low fat, no sugar (the kind you drink, not the kind you cook with)

\- 1 tablespoon tapioca starch

\- 1 teaspoon probiotic powder

&#x200B;

1. Dissolve tapioca starch in a bit of coconut milk. Add to the remaining milk.
2. On a pan, heat the coconut milk + tapioca starch until 60¬∫C, whisking continously.
3. Let milk cool to 43¬∫C. Add probiotic and mix.
4. Get the mixture in the yogurt maker for 6 hours. The yogurt has been sitting on my fridge for 18 hours and it is running.

I'm keen on doing coconut yogurt again but I want to get it right next time. I'd like to use either tapioca starch or gelatin sheets as thickener as these are the ingredients I have at home. What could I have done wrong?

Also, is there any way to save my yogurt now? I don't like smoothies so sadly that's not an option.

Thank you,",2020-07-30

Can I substitute courgette/zucchini for marrow (vegetable) in a ratatouille?,"My friend's grandparents have a surplus of marrow from their garden and I will be cooking for them when they bring my friend back to our flat. I need to plan a good dish to impress them, so was thinking ratatouille, but I want to use the vegetables they bring from their garden. I'm finding way too many stuffed marrow recipes, which seem too easy and boring, so would like to know if I can swap out courgette/zucchini for marrow (the more mature version of the plant) in ratatouille?

I have eaten Indian food twice now, from two different restaurants, trying different dishes from each restaurant. Try as I might, I can‚Äôt bring myself to say anything I tried was good. I noticed all of the dishes I‚Äôve tried (8) all have a similar taste. I tried to google the recipes to see if they all had one same ingredient but I couldn‚Äôt find one. Does anyone know if my taste buds are jacked or if there is in fact one ingredient used in most all Indian dishes?

"Should there be (or is there already) a subreddit where each post requests recipes for a particular dish, responses share recipes that have been personally made (along with their experience), and there is discussion of the different recipes, styles, tips, etc.?","Each time I cook something new, I look over several recipes, read comments/reviews, and figure out whether I want to stick to a single recipe or use some combination of them as inspiration. Subsequent times I tend to look through comments/suggestions for improving things that didn't turn out as well as I had hoped the first time.

As opposed to visiting many different sites, reading through a bunch of comments, and trying to reconcile the disparate information, I'd love to be able to ask for and/or discuss different recipes for a dish.
