about women's thoughts on men's words, appearances, actions, or anything else related to men. Everyone is welcome to participate in Thersday regardless of your own gender, but questions should remain 
focused on women and their experiences and opinions.  Thersdays will run from 12am ET Thursday to 12am ET Friday.

 Examples of things we'll remove:

* What do you think of men who x?

* How does it make you feel when men x?

* What are your best/worst experiences with men?

* If a man does x, how would you react?

If you have any questions about these supplemental rules, please message the moderators and we will be happy to discuss it with you.

Casual Convo Fridays.,"
Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn‚Äôt need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won‚Äôt work if someone‚Äôs only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don‚Äôt need to be on a specific topic, and they don‚Äôt need to be open-ended questions.

* **Secure:** feels confident that their partners will be there for them when needed, and open to depending on others and having others depend on them.
* **Dismissive-avoidant**: they may appear not to care too much about close relationships, and may prefer not to be too dependent upon other people or to have others be too dependent upon them
* **Anxious-preoccupied**:  they worry that others may not love them completely, and be easily frustrated or angered when their attachment needs go unmet
* **Fearful-avoidant** (a.k.a., disorganized): lives in an ambivalent state of being afraid of being both too close to or too distant from others. They attempt to keep their feelings at bay but are unable to; they can't just avoid their anxiety or run away from their feelings

I was very moved by a lot of the experiences you shared and it makes me feel a lot happier knowing that I'm definitely not the only person who has had to deal with stuff like this.

Some of you have been asking for more information about my personal experience, but unfortunately due to the rules of this subreddit I don't think I'm allowed to go into specific details.
However, I was thinking of posting my experience in detail on the r/relationshipadvice subreddit and asking for advice on there, so if people would be interested in seeing that I can let you know and maybe link to it when I post?

Again thanks for all the responses and I'm so glad I recently chose to download reddit because the solidarity between so many people on here is beautiful.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn‚Äôt need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

"Why do so many movies with a woman lead have the theme ""No one believes me""?","I have noticed that a lot of movies with a woman lead actress have a common theme - no one believes her that she has some problem.

I'm watching The Invisible Man and it reminded me that I had noticed this pattern before. But I can't think of any others off the top of my head.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your replies and the awards. I want to read all of your replies but I'm working on a project that is due today. I will read them tomorrow. Maybe at 12:01 AM, maybe 3:00 PM, who knows...

Also, I feel like this is a real fear that's based in real experiences and I wanted to know if it was rare or very common. This is one of those areas where I can never experience what it's like to be you, and you can next experience what it's like to be me, so I thought I'd ask. And it seems to have struck a nerve, so I'm going with 'very common'.",2020-11-23

Now I know the storytelling/characterization of myths is inherently vastly different from how real people would react to these hypotheticals and that this situation is uncomfortably close to real life ordeals and shouldn't be made light of, but I can't help a curiosity about how real people would feel in that situation.",2021-01-01

2 Million Subscribers,"Hello! This week we did something I don't think any of us ever planned or expected - AskWomen has reached 2 million subscribers. 

To celebrate, we wanted to do something different and (hopefully) lighthearted and create an opportunity for us to get to know each other in a direct and personal manner. A chance to see the human behind the screen, so to speak. Obviously we're not going to dox ourselves, but we'd love to discuss with the community a little bit about our experiences as mods, how we have navigated the past 10 years, and ideally, share and discuss some of the truly weird and wild stuff we have seen (and filtered) since 2010.

The format of this topic will be for you to ask questions to mods as a group. Meta questions about specific rules/guidelines/policies, or individual experiences should still be directed to [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskWomen) and as always, questions must fit within the [rules of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/rules). 

Questions about mods life outside of reddit will be answered at individual mod discretion, so while we likely won't answer questions like ""where do you live/where do you work"" very directly, you may find more detail with questions less identifiable like ""how/why did you become an askwomen mod"" or ""How do you find being a mod here affects your life outside of reddit"". That said, we're really looking forward to this, as it's not something we have ever done before and we are excited to interact with our fellow community members more personally.

Thank you everyone for contributing to 2 million members over the last decade, and thank you to everyone who participates in this thread and community in good faith. You're the reason we do this.",2021-01-09

How would you take it if someone figured out your menstrual cycle through observation?,"I'm might be a little dumb regarding this topic so I might get a few things wrong. Feel free to correct me but please don't hate.

I watched Community's S2E8 (Cooperative Calligraphy; great episode, one of the best; solid 10) where Abed Nadir, a character who has difficulty with social skills (possibly has Asperger's syndrome) tries to better his behaviour with 3 ladies in his group. In charting their behaviour to identify a pattern, he figures out what's truly happening and adjusts his lifestyle accordingly to help them. When they find out, one seems impressed, another violated (feels like her privacy is invaded) and the 3rd felt shocked, ig.

Abed did this unknowingly. He tried to understand it from a scientific perspective but found something else. But his adjustment to their behaviour did make things a little better for the group (his words, not mine).

This bought up a few things in my mind.

First, do you even think this is possible? (I'm aware that cycles cause mood swings but with the little research I did, I couldn't find any info on charting them from behaviour). Obviously, 100% verification isn't possible w/o asking the lady herself but do you think it's possible to get it accurate.

Second, how would you feel if someone (m/f friend) did this with the intention of making life easier for you (i.e. they'd do this with the purpose of finding your menstrual cycle so that they could help you since they understand your struggle)?

Note: I've no intention of doing this. Just curious here.",2021-02-10

Mothers of children from both someone they love and do not love: How does it feel?," hi [r/askwomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/) sub,

I (M) was wondering if there is a difference in feeling between having a child from someone you love vs. someone you don't love. I was thinking about this from the perspective of (accidently) becoming pregnant / unplanned pregnancy with the wrong partner compared to having a child with your love. (I am excluding the case where love faded after away having the baby.)

I know this might be a very sensitive topic, so I would really appreciate input from those who have experienced such a situation.

Those who experienced childhood emotional neglect (CEN); how did come to the realisation you experienced it and aside from therapy what has helped you recover from it? What signs do you still exhibit?,"Childhood emotional neglect is a failure of parents or caregivers to respond to a child‚Äôs emotional needs. It‚Äôs can be difficult to ascertain as it‚Äôs done unintentionally or very subtle and not in clearly neglectful or abusive households but those with two parents, high achievers/earners or families that provide children with fundamental needs (food clothing shelter).

Some signs: 
* Feeling empty
* Low self esteem or self worth
* Fear of dependency on others
* Not trusting kindness from others, believing they want something from you 
* Fearing emotional intimacy or emotionally unavailable 
* Needing constant reassurance 
* Unrealistic self image 
* No self compassion but shows high amounts for others 
* Feeling Guilty, anger and shame for reacting or feeling certain emotions 
* Difficulty feeling, expressing or managing emotions

"Muslim ladies: Could you tell us whether or not you'd support no-Hijab day, and how?","I've seen the international World Hijab Day (next one Feb 1st 2022). I think this is a good show of support for women who choose to wear the Hijab, and a good way to show bigots that their anti-Muslim behaviour will not be tolerated.

I've also seen accounts of both Muslim and ex-Muslim women who say they don't want to wear a Hijab but are compelled to by their families, or their communities.

My question is: Would you support them by participating in World No-Hijab Day, in order to show bigots that they should not have control over a woman's body nor make her do things she does not want to (either physical force, social pressure, or any form of verbal coercion)?

If yes, how do you think your family / social group would react? And how would you support them (would you remove your own for a day)?

If no (and you support World Hijab Day), why not?",2021-03-03

When is it ok to disown your family?,"I‚Äôve seen so many comments and posts saying stuff along the lines of ‚Äúditch your parents‚Äù or ‚Äúwalk away‚Äù  ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt owe them anything‚Äù and it goes against everything I‚Äôve been taught about what it means to be a family- a commitment to unconditional love. 

With the exception of physical abuse- I agree no one should remain with the abuser! 

When is it worth all the hurt that comes with cutting off a parent(s) When is working through it or forgiving and forgetting not enough? Who‚Äôs job is it to see through emotional traumas and have compassionate relationship and still maintain healthy boundaries? Is that even possible?

Edit: thank you to everyone who took the time to share their stories and perspectives. I‚Äôll try to respond individually. 

Full disclosure: I have not nor intend to cut off my parents-but I am seeing this play out between a cousin and their parent and I am close with both of them and see the hurt it has caused and the  pattern of ‚Äúcutting off‚Äù as a manipulative tactic in that family dynamic. 

But finding out the true reasons from my cousin and some of my recent realizations of the toxic emotional baggage that is part of that side of my family‚Äôs generations of trauma- I understand why my cousin did it- though personally I have found other ways ( distance- calling it out- refusing to be manipulated) to cope and still have a loving relationship with my family.",2021-03-16

I plan on using your responses like a survey to show her and the therapist that what I am asking for (calmer, kinder, logical conflict) is possible and many couples are doing it.

So I generally wanted to know what are your personal thoughts on throwing food at home or wasting food at restaurants and how do you feel your culture or upbringing has influenced your beliefs and practices in this regard?

How do you get into a new hobby without being discouraged by all the stuff you're supposed to already know?,"For example, I'm starting to garden more after being given a welcome plant at my new office, but everything I read about how to take care of a particular plant seems to think that I already know what I'm doing. Like, it'll say ""be careful not to overwater"" but how will I know if I'm overwatering? (I have since learned the answer to this question, but several plants sacrificed their lives for it, which was upsetting and frustrating.)

Same thing happened when I started working out, and I get questions from people who've just started knitting and hit similar barriers, so I think it's a common problem with trying to teach yourself something through impersonal resources.

"Update: Supplementary rules for Thersday here to stay, a clarification regarding our disrespectful commentary rule, and a THANK YOU!","Hey everyone! Hope your June is off to a fine start. We're here with some notes and updates about moderation policy. Without further delay:

# Thersday

You suggested and we listened: you wanted a day free of motherhood, parenting, pregnancy, and similar related posts! In response, we expanded our theme day, Thersday, to limit posts only to women themselves, outside of any relationships with other people. It was initially implemented as a trial, and we are happy to announce that due to good feedback, this change is here to stay. We‚Äôre pleased with the creativity and variety of topics posted as a result of theme days, and as far as we can tell, so are you!

# An important clarification regarding our rule against disrespectful commentary

At AskWomen, we strive to be an inclusive space. Statistically, approximately 1 in 5 adults will experience some form of mental illness in their lifetime. As we grow as a subreddit, we want to maintain a space where we can both include and be understanding of one another. As such, we are expanding this policy to now include pathologizing language/armchair diagnosing. We feel that, whether intentional or not, casual use of diagnostic labels to describe everyday behaviour can exclude and be harmful to people experiencing mental illness.

It is not fair to people with mental illness to attribute every feeling or action to their condition, particularly the choice to abuse. Plenty of people living with mental illnesses are capable of living a life free of abusing others, just as some abusers who have no known psychiatric conditions make the conscious choice to abuse, every day.

In short, we are asking our community to **avoid using terms for mental health issues as judgments, slurs, or synonyms for toxic behaviour.** Posts and comments will be encouraged, where possible, to use non-pathologizing/clinical adjectives to describe traits/behaviours.

# Examples of using these terms as judgements, slurs, or careless casual use

**Usage of words/labels like:**

* ‚ÄúOCD‚Äù (to mean something like fastidious, particular, picky, fussy)
* ‚Äúnarcissist‚Äù (to mean something like self-absorbed, arrogant, toxic, selfish, abusive)
* ‚Äúborderline/BPD‚Äù (to mean something like unstable, unpredictable, moody)
* ""schizo‚Äô‚Äô (to mean something like paranoid, erratic, or eccentric)
* ‚ÄúADHD‚Äù (to mean something like hyperactive, jittery, inattentive)
* ‚Äúpsycho(path)‚Äô‚Äô or ""sociopath‚Äô‚Äô (to mean something like angry, jealous, controlling, abusive...) and similar.

If a diagnostic label can be replaced by another word, it must be used instead. In our experience, the more common synonyms might be ""abuser‚Äô‚Äô/‚Äô‚Äôabusive‚Äô‚Äô, ""toxic (of a behaviour or person)‚Äô‚Äô, or ""asshole‚Äô‚Äô. You always have your pick of non-gendered slurs and insults, too!

**Armchair diagnostics or speculation about possible diagnoses:**

* **‚Äò**‚ÄôThat sounds like x‚Äô‚Äô,
* ""I think my ex was y""
* ‚Äò‚ÄôI think my mom has/is z‚Äô‚Äô

**Exceptions:**

* Talking about your own, diagnosed condition and how it affects you
* Talking about your family member, friend, or other person with a diagnosed condition, and how it affects you, in a submission in which you are the requested demographic (eg. addressed to friends/family members of people with x, not people with x).
* Talking about yourself/someone in your life who is seeking a diagnosis, but does not have one yet (eg - ""my friend is starting the process of getting tested for ADHD"")
* Talking about famous people and figures who have the diagnosis, if it is relevant

Application of these rules is at moderator discretion. We may remove other common labels or descriptors (for instance ""crazy"") if mods feel that they were used in a blatantly disrespectful manner. Please[ send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskwomenmods) if you would like to discuss a removed comment or post.

We know that the use of some of these labels is very common on Reddit, so it's natural that some of these terms might be used by accident. Please know that a request to edit your post does not mean that you are in trouble; fix it and we will be happy to put it back up! We process too much content to pay attention to usernames, so please be assured that it's not some kind of mark against you as a participant :)

# You're the best!

With all that out of the way, we love being part of such an active, caring community. By reporting rule-breaking content, upvoting good questions, and downvoting only when content is in bad faith or does not contribute meaningfully to the community, you help out more than you can know. **Please continue to do an excellent job being excellent to each other, and thank you!**",2021-06-05

FAQ Update - What was your experience with cosmetic breast surgery?,"Hello!

Given the large amount of breast surgery questions we've been getting, we thought it's best to catch them all in one post for easier finding! To keep things organized and easier to find, we're gonna have separate top-level comments where you can reply with your experience with **[augmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/opfl1v/faq_update_what_was_your_experience_with_cosmetic/h64tu82/)**, **[reduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/opfl1v/faq_update_what_was_your_experience_with_cosmetic/h64twsm/)**, **[lift](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/opfl1v/faq_update_what_was_your_experience_with_cosmetic/h64txa8/)** and **[reconstructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/opfl1v/faq_update_what_was_your_experience_with_cosmetic/h64txrk/)** surgery.

Let the following prompts be your guide, but don't feel pressured to cover them all if you don't feel comfortable. Talk about everything on the list, or only a few things, and add whatever else you think is relevant. We are going to try to take a relatively hands-off approach to allow for plenty of discussion, but if you feel anything is derailing or invalidating, please do report it so that we can take action. Don't be a perv, **creeps will be banned on the spot with no warning.**

What is your opinion on the sexual harassment lawsuits in Activision?,"[https://www.cnet.com/news/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-walkout-ceo-response-and-everything-you-need-to-know/](https://www.cnet.com/news/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-walkout-ceo-response-and-everything-you-need-to-know/)

&#x200B;

 

When dozens of Activision Blizzard employees [staged a walkout on Wednesday](https://www.cnet.com/news/activision-blizzard-walkout-organizers-demand-change-amid-ceos-response-to-lawsuit/) it was the latest update in a troubling week for the company behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. Activision Blizzard has been rocked by¬†[an explosive lawsuit filing last week](https://www.cnet.com/news/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-frat-boy-workplace-culture/) when the state of California accused it of workplace discrimination against its female workforce.¬†

The suit, [filed by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing](https://aboutblaw.com/YJw), argues that the company has a ""frat boy"" workplace culture and alleges several alarming incidents of discrimination and harassment.

  

Activision Blizzard is accused of workplace discrimination. It alleges women are compensated unfairly -- paid less for the same job, scrutinized more heavily than their male peers -- and subject to considerable harassment. The agency called Activision Blizzard a ""breeding ground for harassment and discrimination,"" in which women are subject to regular sexual advances by (often high-ranking) men who largely go unpunished. ¬†

Illustrative of the claims DFEH is making against Activision is an office ritual referred to as ""cube crawls,"" in which men allegedly drink ""copious"" amounts of alcohol, crawl through the office cubicles and engage in ""inappropriate behavior"" including groping. The lawsuit describes incidents including allegations that a female employee died by suicide during a business trip as a result of a toxic relationship with a supervisor. ¬†

Edit5: I should have said this earlier but this is not something ¬´¬†all women¬†¬ª face.

How/When should I tell her I never had sex?,"Hello, I am 28 years old guy who did not have sex before. why? I had a relationship when I was younger but my ex girlfriend did not want to have until we're engaged /soon to be married / married, and I totally respected that, then after we broke up I focused more on my studies, career, financial investments, hobbies...,  and did not pay attention that I am getting old and did not have sex yet.  


Currently I am seeing this girl, she is 23 and she had sex before (FWB situation), but she's never been in a serious relationship before. She is a great person that I really don't want to mess up things with ( even if our relation does not work out, i don't wanna lose her as a friend).  


I am under stress right now and become very nervous when I think when should I and how should I tell her (Because I will, I don't like the idea of deceiving/tricking someone into something they don't wanna). Should I tell her when we're about to have sex, or when the topic arises? I really hope she asks me and get done with this stress.  


I am not nervous of having sex itself, I know I will not be as good as any experienced man but I will learn and practice makes perfect.  


BTW, I am not ashamed or something of not having sex till now, because It was my decision after all (I do have some regrets)and I have a good career and in general I am successful. And also not afraid of her telling me no, because it is nothing personal and it might  just be her preference at the moment, but afraid that things might be complicated and lose her.  


Thanks in advance. üòä",2021-09-05

"When you rip tights on purpose, what do you do with them after taking them off?","I used to frequent a lot of independent heavy/power-metal concerts. What I've noticed  
ripped (mostly black) tights/pantyhose are a rather popular fashion choice. Sometimes  
I see women like this on the street. It looks... kind of a good. However how in the world  
do you reuse them? I understand that when they are super-thick it might be feasible,but  
with more normal like 20 or 40 denier, maybe 60... I am not really convinced. In the city  
I live it's cheaper to get a pair of tights than a can of Monster. I think it's feasible to just  
wear them once to the concert and throw them out, even buy a new pair every day.  
So... after you ripped the tights to get a certain look WHAT do you do with them?",2021-11-11

"Woman of Reddit, what is your ‚Äúthis man ain‚Äôt shit‚Äù story?","*Edit: Hello, everyone. I just wanted to say that I wrote this question out of curiosity and for a direction of self improvement. I wanted to see what I could do to better myself as an all around person for myself and for the people around me- whether it be my family, friends or future partner. 

Let me just say that some of the things that have occurred to some of these wonderful ladies in the comment section is outrageous. Many of these stories tell of men that can‚Äôt even do the bare minimum of basic human decency and respect. 

I was utterly dumbfounded by how men, well above their ‚Äúkid‚Äù or ‚Äúyoung man‚Äù years, couldn‚Äôt do the fundamental necessities of being in a relationship with an actual human being, and in some cases, even for themselves. The amount of hypocrisy, greediness and apathy that was discussed in many of these examples is unbearable and almost unbelievable. Some of this behavior I would expect from a 16 year old, some I would expect from a child, but certainly not a 30 year old. 

Such examples of this include lack of knowledge of consent, lack of taking responsibility for one‚Äôs actions , and overall lack of care for someone else. 

I did indeed want to read these comments to see if I have done anything wrong, what to avoid doing and what behavior can be seen as proactive and socially appropriate. I wanted to  be open minded and even exposed to certain aspects of what I can do and what I cannot. What I read through the comments was men without basic common sense, dignity kindness, and respect. 

I apologize to everyone who has gone through a toxic and/or abusive relationship in the past and I wish you the very best for right now and in the future :)",2022-01-15

How do you balance your own desires vs. others' in suggesting plans?,"To put it briefly, I've been a huge people pleaser my whole life (working on it...). 

It's a particular problem when it comes to making social plans and arranging visits and travel. When I'm doing anything that affects anyone else, I tend to (consciously and subconsciously) try to figure out what will please them or create the least conflict or inconvenience for others, and go from there. 

This obviously hasn't been a winning strategy (for myself or those in my life) for about a million reasons, so now I'm trying (laughably late in life) to figure out how people without this tendency go about making plans with others. I have to acknowledge that I have no other reference point for planning respectfully with others besides my lifelong go-to, ""whatever route I think will result in the least overall disappointment or conflict with others."" 

I know it seems silly, but really wondering how you do this if you're comfortable with your process. For example, this summer I have two wedding events two weeks apart on the other side of the country, and endless possibilities around them for where I go and when and for how long and who I visit and which parts I try to have my husband join for (since he has less flexible work -- we have no kids -- dog care is a factor but manageable regardless of what we choose).

Now that I'm trying to do things differently, do I just literally decide exactly how I'd personally like to do this trip and then discuss just what I personally want to see how my husband/family/friends feel about it (outside the wedding events themselves of course)? It feels so weird to not caveat every idea by worrying about how the proposal will make other people feel.",2022-03-03

Wikipedia: ‚ÄúQueen bee‚Äù is a derogatory term applied to women who have achieved  success in traditionally male-dominated fields. These women often take  on ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù traits and distance themselves from other women in the  workplace in order to succeed. They may also view or treat subordinates more critically if they are  female, and refuse to help other women rise up the ranks as a form of  self-preservation.

A recent report on the state of pay for women in 2022 highlighted some really interesting findings when it comes to pay transparency and what women think about discussing salaries, salary negotiation, transparent comp philosophies, etc. 

One of these was that those who identify as Black, Latina, and Native American women **report lower earnings on average.** While Multiracial women have the highest mean salaries, followed by Asian women, then, by White women.

They also found that **negotiation didn‚Äôt lead to equitable pay** for those who identify as Black & Latina women. When Black & Latina women negotiated, they achieved an average salary at the level of Asian and White women who didn‚Äôt negotiate.

I thought these findings were so fascinating... what do yall think?

"Women who have played/seen/heard of The Closing Shift, how accurate was it (in terms of what it's like to be a woman or being stalked) in your opinion?","For more context the game is made by Chilla's Art, and it is about the main character (who is a woman) part-timing as a barista, and has a stalker.

**EDIT:** Adding more context to the game, *beware of content* (stalking + letters, murder and never confirmed/possible/implied assault).

Most of the let's players (of the game) were dudes and a commenter (of a video compiling their reactions) pointed out how they (the guys) were mostly worried about getting killed, and how Gab Smolders (the only woman included in the compilation, I haven't seen much women playing it on YT but there are some) was calm and immedietly went to the bathroom and (the commenter) would like to see how other women would've handled that certain part of the game (where the stalker confronted them outside whilst the player was inside)

**CONTENT WARNING AND SPOILERS:** >!It's been theorized that the MC might have two stalkers, but I'll talk about the main one (who is the one who attacks her in all endings)!<

>!So at the start of the game, the MC tries to get to work from her car - she spots a flip phone on the way and returns it to this guy who recognizes is his point (he later turns out to be the stalker, which... Well, it's just disturbing how that happened from *only one* interaction).!<

>!A customer who turns out to be a private investigator warns the MC about how police often won't do anything until something has already happened, and gives the MC his number if she has any information because some cases have been coming out, and she *is* working the *night* shift!<

>!Later, the stalker often comes to the MC's workplace, just staring at her sometimes (I forgot if he ever tried to order anything) and even the other customers would point this out, asking the MC if she knows the man, or asking if the store is being advertised - since a man is taking photos of it, even some high school/college girls were talking about this creep after they ordered.!<

>!On a certain night, the MC is about to close the store - when he stalker jumpscares the player, and this is checkpoint of multiple endings start, but one thing that is **canon for all endings** is that *before* this sequence, the MC called the private investigator - told him about the stalker, and he tried to investigate, but ended up getting killed.!<

>!First ending, MC runs out of the storage (?) room and is captured... This ending well... Has the MC being beat up on the road, I believe? And there were some... *Animalistic* noises... It hasn't been confirmed if it's *that* since it happened in a span of two to fifteen seconds (timelapsed).!<

>!Second ending, is that the MC makes an escapes through a vent to arrive at the drive-through area, where her keys are *convieniently* left at, once she reaches her car - the stalker is waiting at the backseat.!<

>!The third ending, like the second one is framed to be a ""good"" ending as well - the MC reaches the roof of the store using a ladder, there will be cinderblocks you can drop on the stalker - which the MC does.!<

>!The MC, distraught from killing someone, calls the police and informs them about the stalking - they arrive at the scene, but there was no evidence found, not even the dead investigator.!<

>!The MC returns back to her apartment after being told to do so by the police, cellphone suddenly rings - but it's outside beside your car. After returning to her apartment and calling someone, the stalker emerges from the closet - who entered while the MC was looking for her phone.!<

Maybe it's just because I want there to be a happy ending, >!but I prefer to think that third ending ended with the stalker being dead - since *there's no way* he could *hide/erase* the *blood* of the private investigator and his *body* **off snow** in *mere minutes*, also he got **hit on the head** by a *concrete*.!<",2022-04-28

How has the pressure to conform to beauty ideals had a negative impact on your life?,"Assuming it has! 
The pressure to conform to beauty ideals is oppressive for many. Men are seriously affected by the emphasis on height and muscularity. I am a male sufferer of BDD (in recovery). My own BDD was triggered by appearance-based abuse. I have battled serious body-image issues since I was 12.That said, women have been subjected to these ideals for centuries, so the structures are more rigid and ingrained.Eating disorders, and body dysmorphia are still more prevalent in women. The beauty ideal for women is narrower and more extensive . Women's competence is often judged by the extent to which they conform to beauty norms.
